24@The Fray@How To Save A Life@Step one: you say we need to talk He walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk He smiles politely back at you, You stare politely right on through Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along In the bitterness and I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Let him know that you know best 'Cause after all you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things you've told him all along And pray to God he hears you And pray to God he hears you  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along In the bitterness and I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or brake with the ones you've followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or he'll say he's just not the same And you'll begin to wonder why you came  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along In the bitterness and I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life   Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along In the bitterness and I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life How to save a life How to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along In the bitterness and I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along In the bitterness and I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life How to save a life How to save a life
