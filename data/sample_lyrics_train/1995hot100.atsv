2@TLC@Waterfalls@A lonely mother gazing out of her window Staring at a son that she just can't touch If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much  But all the praying just ain't helping at all 'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how Another body laying cold in the gutter Listen to me  Don't go chasin' waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast  Little Precious has a natural obsession For temptation but he just can't see She gives him loving that his body can't handle But all he can say is,"Baby it's good to me."  One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror But he doesn't recognize his own face His health is fading and he doesn't know why Three letters took him to his final resting place Ya'll don't hear me  Don't go chasin' waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast  Don't go chasin' waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast  Come On I seen a rainbow yesterday But too many storms have come and gone Leavin' a trace of not one God given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray I pray all ten fade away Seldom praise Him for the sunny days  And like his promise is true Only my faith can undo The many chances I blew To bring my life to anew Clear blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes No more lonely cries  My only bleedin' hope Is for the folk who can't cope Wit such an endurin' pain That it keeps em' in the pourin' rain Who's to blame For tootin' caine into your own vein What a shame You shoot and aim for someone else's brain  You claim the insane And name this day and time For fallin' prey to crime I say the system got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations In hopes of comin' true Believe in yourself The rest is up to me and you  Don't go chasin' waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast  Don't go chasin' waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast

Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  And shake me and my confidence About a great many things But I've been there I can see it cower Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings  Of a bad play where the heroes are right And nobody thinks or expects too much And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights Singing hey babe, let's keep in touch Hey baby, let's keep in touch  But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me And show me all the things no one else can see So what you feel becomes mine as well And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line  But you Why you wanna give me a run-around? Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  Tra la la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking And I've got some news for you It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop And there ain't a whole lot that you can do  Oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder Perhaps I've grown a little cynical But I know no matter what the waitress brings I shall drink it and always be full Yeah, I will drink it and always be full  Oh I like coffee, and I like tea I'd like to be able to enter a final plea I still got this dream that you just can't shake I love you to the point you can no longer take  Well, all right, okay So be that way, I hope and pray That there's something left to say  But you Why you wanna give me a run-around? Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  But you Why you wanna give me a run-around? Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?

17@Bon Jovi@Always@This Romeo is bleeding But you can't see his blood It's nothing but some feelings That this old dog kicked up  It's been raining since you left me Now I'm drowning in the flood You see, I've always been a fighter But without you, I give up  I can't sing a love song Like the way it's meant to be Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore But baby, that's just me  And I will love you, baby, always And I'll be there forever and a day, always I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine 'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind And I'll love you, always  Now your pictures that you left behind Are just memories of a different life Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry One that made you have to say goodbye What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair To touch your lips, to hold you near When you say your prayers, try to understand I've made mistakes, I'm just a man  When he holds you close, when he pulls you near When he says the words you've been needing to hear I wish I was him With these words of mine To say to you 'til the end of time  That I will love you baby, always And I'll be there forever and a day, always  If you told me to cry for you, I could If you told me to die for you, I would Take a look at my face There's no price I won't pay To say these words to you  Well, there ain't no luck In these loaded dice But baby if you give me just one more try We can pack up our old dreams And our old lives We'll find a place where the sun still shines  And I will love you, baby, always And I'll be there forever and a day, always I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine 'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme I know when I die, you'll be on my mind And I'll love you, always  Always, always
