15@Marty Robbins@El Paso@Out in the West Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina Music would play and Faleena would whirl  Blacker than night were the eyes of Faleena Wicked and evil while casting a spell My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love, but in vain, I could tell  One night a wild young cowboy came in Wild as the West Texas wind Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing With wicked Faleena, the girl that I loved  So in anger I Challenged his right for the love of this maiden Down went his hand for the gun that he wore My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  Just for a moment I stood there in silence Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there I had but one chance and that was to run  Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran Out where the horses were tied I caught a good one, it looked like it could run Up on its back and away I did ride  Just as fast as I Could from the West Texas town of El Paso Out to the badlands of New Mexico  Back in El Paso my life would be worthless Everything's gone in life; nothing is left It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden My love is stronger than my fear of death  I saddled up and away I did go Riding alone in the dark Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart  And at last here I Am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's cantina below My love is strong and it pushes me onward Down off the hill to Felina I go  Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys Off to my left ride a dozen or more Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me I have to make it to Rosa's back door  Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel A deep burning pain in my side Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary, unable to ride  But my love for Faleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen Though I am weary I can't stop to rest I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my chest  From out of nowhere Faleena has found me Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for One little kiss and Faleena, goodbye
