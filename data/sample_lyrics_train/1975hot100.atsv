19@Janis Ian@At Seventeen@I learned the truth at seventeen That love was meant for beauty queens And high school girls with clear skinned smiles Who married young and then retired. The valentines I never knew The Friday night charades of youth Were spent on one more beautiful At seventeen I learned the truth  And those of us with ravaged faces Lacking in the social graces Desperately remained at home Inventing lovers on the phone Who called to say come dance with me and murmured vague obscenities It isn't all it seems At seventeen  A brown eyed girl in hand me downs Whose name I never could pronounce Said, "Pity please the ones who serve, They only get what they deserve" The rich relationed hometown queen Marries into what she needs With a guarantee of company And haven for the elderly  Remember those who win the game Lose the love they sought to gain In debentures of quality And dubious integrity Their small town eyes will gape at you In dull surprise when payment due Exceeds accounts received At seventeen  To those of us who know the pain of valentines that never came And those whose names were never called When choosing sides for basketball It was long ago and far away The world was younger than today And dreams were all they gave for free To ugly duckling girls like me  We all play the game and when we dare To cheat ourselves at solitaire Inventing lovers on the phone Repenting other lives unknown That call and say, come dance with me and murmur vague obscenities At ugly girls like me At seventeen

38@Harry Chapin@Cat's In The Cradle@Child arrived just the other day He came to the world in the usual way But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay He learned to walk while I was away And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew He'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, dad. You know I'm gonna be like you."  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon "When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then. You know we'll have a good time then."  My son turned ten just the other day He said, "Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play. Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today, I got a lot to do." He said, "That's okay." And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed Said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know I'm gonna be like him."  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon "When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then. You know we'll have a good time then."  Well, he came from college just the other day So much like a man I just had to say "Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?" He shook his head and he said with a smile "What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys. See you later. Can I have them please?"  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon "When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then, dad. You know we'll have a good time then."  I've long since retired,my son's moved away I called him up just the other day I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind." He said, "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu. But it's sure nice talking to you, dad. It's been sure nice talking to you." And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me He'd grown up just like me My boy was just like me  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon "When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then, dad. We're gonna have a good time then."

89@Jethro Tull@Bungle In The Jungle@Walking through forests of palm tree apartments Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents Down by the waterhole, drunk every Friday Eating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday Lions and tigers who wait in the shadows They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows  Well, let's bungle in the jungle Well, that's all right by me, yes Well, I'm a tiger when I want love And I'm a snake if we disagree  Just say a word and the boys will be right there With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder? Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder I'll write on your tombstone, I thank you for dinner This game that we animals play is a winner  Well, let's bungle in the jungle Well, that's all right by me, yes I'm a tiger when I want love I'm a snake if we disagree  The rivers are full of crocodile nasties And he who made kittens put snakes in the grass, he's A lover of life, but a player of pawns Yes, the king on his sunset lies waiting for dawn To light up his jungle as play is resumed The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune  Well, let's bungle in the jungle Well, that's all right by me, yes I'm a tiger when I want love And I'm a snake when we disagree Yes, let's bungle in the jungle Well, that's all right by me, yes Well, I'm a tiger when I want love I'm a snake when we disagree Well, let's bungle in the jungle Well, that's all right by me, yes I'm a tiger when I want love
