3@Katy Perry@Firework@Do you ever feel like a plastic bag Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?  Do you ever feel already buried deep? Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you? 'Cause there's a spark in you  You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine Just own the night like the Fourth of July  'Cause baby, you're a firework Come on, show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!" As you shoot across the sky-y-y  Baby, you're a firework Come on, let your colors burst Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!" You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe  You don't have to feel like a waste of space You're original, cannot be replaced If you only knew what the future holds After a hurricane, comes a rainbow  Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow And when it's time you know  You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine Just own the night like the Fourth of July  'Cause baby, you're a firework Come on, show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!" As you shoot across the sky-y-y  Baby, you're a firework Come on, let your colors burst Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!" You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe  Boom, boom, boom Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon It's always been inside of you, you, you And now it's time to let it through  'Cause baby, you're a firework Come on, show 'em what you're worth Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!" As you shoot across the sky-y-y  Baby, you're a firework Come on, let your colors burst Make 'em go "Ah, ah, ah!" You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe  Boom, boom, boom Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon Boom, boom, boom Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Yeah You're listening now They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while That's why they play my song on so many different dials  Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barack I cried tear drops over the massive attack  I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat Look at my jacket and hat So damn berserk So down to Earth  I'm bringing gravity back Adopted by the major I want my family back People work hard just to get all their salary taxed  Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn I used to be the kid that no one cared about That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out  [Chorus] Oh Written in the stars A million miles away A message to the main Ooooh Seasons come and go But I will never change And I'm on my way Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh  [Tinie Tempah - Verse 2] Yeah, I needed a change When we ate we never tipped cause we needed the change I needed a break For a sec I even gave up believing and praying  I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray They say money is the root to the evilest ways But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake? Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed  Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam Since the day I thought of that cunning plan One day I had a dream I tried to chase it But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!  I knew that maybe someday I would understand Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand Everyone's a kid that no one cares about You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out  [Chorus] Oh Written in the stars A million miles away A message to the main Ooooh Seasons come and go But I will never change And I'm on my way Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh  [Chorus] Oh Written in the stars A million miles away A message to the main Ohhhh The seasons come and go But I will never change And I'm on my way!
