Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more The space between... The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain  But will I hold you again  These fickle fuddled words confuse me Like will it rain today We waste the hours with talking, talking These twisted games we're playing  We're strange allies With warring hearts What a wild eyed beast you be  The space between The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain  But will I hold you again Will I hold  Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster You know you went off like the devil in the church In the middle of a crowded room All we can do my love Is hope we don't take this ship down  The space between Where you smile and hide Is where you'll find me if I get to go  The space between The bullets in our fire fight Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you The rain that falls Splashed in your heart Ran like sadness down the window into your room  The space between Our wicked lies is Where we hope to keep safe from pain  Take my hand Cause we're walking out of here Right out of here Love is all we need dear  The space between What's wrong and right Is where you'll find me hiding Waiting for you  The space between In your heart and mine Is the space we'll fill with time  The space between

73@Lonestar@I'm Already There@He called her on the road From a lonely cold hotel room Just to hear her say I love you one more time And when he heard the sound Of the kids laughing in the background He had to wipe away a tear from his eye A little voice came on the phone She said Daddy when you coming home? He said the first thing that came to his mind  I'm already there Take a look around I'm the sunshine in your hair I'm the shadow on the ground I'm the whisper in the wind I'm your imaginary friend And I know I'm in your prayers Oh I'm already there  She got back on the phone Said, I really miss you darlin' Don't worry about the kids They'll be all right Wish I was in your arms Lyin' right there beside you But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight And I'll gently kiss your lips Touch you with my fingertips So turn out the light and close your eyes  I'm already there Don't make a sound I'm the beat in your heart I'm the moonlight shining down I'm the whisper in the wind And I'll be there to the end Can you feel the love that we share? Oh I'm already there  We may be a Thousand miles apart But I'll be with you Wherever you are  I'm already there Take a look around I'm the sunshine in your hair I'm the shadow on the ground I'm the whisper in the wind And I'll be there to the end Can you feel the love that we share? Oh I'm already there  Oh I'm already there

75@U2@Beautiful Day@The heart is a bloom Shoots up through the story ground There's no room No space to rent in this town You're out of luck And the reason that you had to care The traffic is stuck And you're not moving anywhere You thought you'd found a friend To take you out of this place Someone you could lend, a hand In return for grace  It's a beautiful day The sky falls And you feel like It's a beautiful day Don't let it get away  You're on the road But you've got no destination You're in the mud In the maze of her imagination You love this town Even if it doesn't ring true You've been all over And it's been all over you  It's a beautiful day Don't let it get away It's a beautiful day  Touch me Take me to that other place Teach me I know I'm not a hopeless case  See the world in green and blue See China right in front of you See the canyons broken by cloud See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out See the Bedouin fires at night See the oil fields at first light and See the bird with a leaf in her mouth After the flood all the colours came out  It was a beautiful day Don't let it get away Beautiful day  Touch me Take me to that other place Reach me I know I'm not a hopeless case  What you don't have you don't need it now What you don't know you can feel it somehow What you don't have you don't need it now Don't need it now  It's a beautiful day

The telephone fell to the counter She heard but she couldn't believe What kinda man would hang on that long What kinda love that must be She waited three days And then she tried again She didn't know what she'd say But she heard three rings and then  If it's Friday night, I'm at the ball game And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain I'm headed out to the lake And I'll be gone all weekend long But I'll call you back When I get home On Sunday afternoon, And P.S. if this is Austin I still love you  This time she left her number But not another word Then she waited by the phone On Sunday evening And this is what he heard  If you're calling 'bout my heart It's still yours I shoulda listened to it a little more Then it wouldn't have Taken me so long To know where I belong And by the way boy This is no machine you're talking to Can't you tell this is Austin And I still love you ...I still love you

78@Tim McGraw@Grown Men Don't Cry@I pulled into the shopping center And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother. Like ice cream melting, they embraced, Years of bad decisions running down her face. All mornin' I'd been thinking my life's so hard, And they wore everything they owned, living in a car. I wanted to tell 'em it would be okay, But I just got in my Suburban and I drove away.  And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry. I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.  Keep having this dream about my old man, I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand. We're talking on the front porch Watching the sun go down, But it was just a dream. He was a slave to his job And he couldn't be around. So many things I want to say to him, But I just placed a rose on his grave, And I talked to the wind.  And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry. I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry.  I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife And everything that I hold dear in my life. We say grace, and thank the Lord Got so much to be thankful for. Then its up the stairs and off to bed And my little girl says, "I haven't had my story, yet." And everything weighing on my mind disapears just like that When she lifts her head off her pillow and says, "I love you, dad!"  And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry. I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.  And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry. I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry.
