The winner takes it all!  So the winner takes it all And the loser has to fall  Throw a dice Cold as ice Way down here Someone near  Takes it all Has to fall

79@Dan Fogelberg@Same Old Lang Syne@Met my old lover in the grocery store The snow was falling Christmas Eve I stole behind her in the frozen foods And I touched her on the sleeve  She didn't recognize the face at first But then her eyes flew open wide She went to hug me and she spilled her purse And we laughed until we cried  We took her groceries to the checkout stand The food was totaled up and bagged We stood there lost in our embarrassment As the conversation dragged  Went to have ourselves a drink or two But couldn't find an open bar We bought a six-pack at the liquor store And we drank it in her car  We drank a toast to innocence We drank a toast to now And tried to reach beyond the emptiness But neither one knew how  She said she'd married her an architect Who kept her warm and safe and dry She would have liked to say she loved the man But she didn't like to lie  I said the years had been a friend to her And that her eyes were still as blue But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I Saw doubt or gratitude  She said she saw me in the record stores And that I must be doing well I said the audience was heavenly But the traveling was hell  We drank a toast to innocence We drank a toast to now And tried to reach beyond the emptiness But neither one knew how  We drank a toast to innocence We drank a toast to time Reliving in our eloquence Another 'auld lang syne'  The beer was empty and our tongues were tired And running out of things to say She gave a kiss to me as I got out And I watched her drive away  Just for a moment I was back at school And felt that old familiar pain And as I turned to make my way back home The snow turned into rain

84@Santana@Winning@One day I was on the ground When I needed a hand And it couldn't be found I was so far down That I couldn't get up You know and One day I was one of life's losers Even my friends were my accusers And in my head Lost before I'd begun  I had a dream But it turned to dust What I thought was love That must have been lust I was living in style When the walls fell in When I played my hand I looked like a joker Turn around Fate must have woke her 'Cause lady luck she was Waiting outside the door  Chorus: I'm winning I'm winning I'm winning And I don't intend on losing again  Too bad it belonged to me It was the wrong time And not meant to be It took a long time And I knew for now I can see the day That I breathe for Friends agree there's a need To play the game And to win again  Chorus: (repeat first line 5x) (repeat last line 4x)  Repeat Verse II  Chorus: (repeat first line 5x)

Can you make these big wheels burn?  Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin' I keep on callin' her name Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin' I can't go on hurtin' this way She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain  I can't blame her for lettin' go A woman needs someone warm to hold I feel the rain runnin' down my face I'll find her no matter what it takes!

89@Barry Manilow@I Made It Through The Rain@We dreamers have our ways Of facing rainy days And somehow we survive  We keep the feelings warm Protect them from the storm Until our time arrives  Then one day the sun appears And we come shining through those lonely years  I made it through the rain I kept my world protected I made it throught the rain I kept my point of view I made it through the rain And found myself respected By the others who Got rained on too And made it through  When friends are hard to find And life seems so unkind Sometimes you feel afraid  Just aim beyond the clouds And rise above the crowds And start your own parade  'Cause when I chased my fears away That's when I knew that I could finally say  I made it through the rain I kept my world protected I made it throught the rain I kept my point of view I made it through the rain And found myself respected By the others who Got rained on too And made it through...
