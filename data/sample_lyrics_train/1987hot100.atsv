44@Samantha Fox@Touch Me (I Want Your Body)@Full moon in the city And the night was young I was hungry for love I was hungry for fun  I was hunting you down And I was the bait When I saw you there I didn't mean to hesitate  This is the night This is the night This is the time we've got to get it right  (This is the night) Touch me, touch me I want to feel your body Your heart beat next to mine (This is the night) Touch me, touch me now  Quick as a flash you disappeared into the night Did I hurt you boy? Didn't I treat you right? You made me feel so good Made me feel myself Now I'm alone and you're with somebody else  This is the night, yeah This is the night This is the time we've got to get it right  (This is the night) Touch me, touch me I want to feel your body Your heart beat next to mine (This is the night) Touch me, touch me now Touch me, touch me now Touch me, touch me now  Hot and cold emotions confusing my brain I could not decide between pleasure and pain Like a tramp in the night I was begging for you To treat my body like you wanted to  Uh.... Uh, it's begging for you  (This is the night) Touch me, touch me I want to feel your body Your heart beat next to mine (This is the night) 'Cos I want your body all the time  (This is the night) Touch me, touch me I want to feel your body Your heart beat next to mine (This is the night) 'Cos I want your body all the time
