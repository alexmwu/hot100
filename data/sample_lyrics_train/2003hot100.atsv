26@Black Eyed Peas@Where is the Love?@What's wrong with the world, mama? People livin' like they ain't got no mamas I think the whole world's addicted to the drama Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma  Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK  But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah  Madness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how anger works and operates Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach Or would you turn the other cheek?  Father, Father, Father help us Send some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love? (love)  Where is the love? (the love) Where is the love? (the love)  Where is the love, the love, the love?  It just ain't the same, all ways are changed New days are strange, is the world insane? If love and peace is so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?  Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone?  So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover  The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug If you never know truth then you never know love Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know) Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know) Where's the love, y'all (come on yeah)  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach Or would you turn the other cheek?

(the love) Where is the love? Where is the love? Where is the love? (the love) Where is the love? (the love)  Where is the love, the love, the love?  I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder Most of us only care about money makin' Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction  Wrong information always shown by the media Negative images, is the main criteria Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas  Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity  That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself)  Where is the love? Where is the love? Where is the love? Where is the love?  Father, Father, Father help us Send some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love?

Singin' songs, later on, but the younger version, Hung wit' the wrong person, got her stunger than heroine, Cocaine, sniffin' up drugs all in her nose, Could've died so young, now looks ugly and old, No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold thier breath Cuz she smells of corrosion and death, Watch the company you keep, and the crowd you bring, Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing, So if you gonna be the best im'a tell you how, Put your hands in the air and take the vow  I know I can (I know I can) Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be) If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it) I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be what I wanna be) [I know I can] (I know I can) [Be what i wanna be] (Be what I wanna be) [If I work hard at it] (If I work hard at it) [I'll be where I wanna be] (I'll be where I wanna be)  B, b, boys and girls listen again This is for grown looking girls who's only ten. The ones who watch videos and do what they see As cute as can be, up in the clubs with fake ID. Careful 'fore you meet a man with HIV. You can host a TV like Oprah Winfrey Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be Rapists so act your age, don't pretend to be Older than you are, give yourself time to grow, You're thinking he can give you wealth but so Young boy, you could use a lot of help you know Ya thinkin' life's all about smokin' weed and ice. You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write, Beggin' different women for a place to sleep at night. Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish.

There was empires in Africa called Kush, Timbuktu, where every race came to get books To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans, Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold; When gold was converted to money it all changed, Money then became empowerment for Europeans. The Persian military invaded, They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred Africa was almost robbed naked, Slavery was money, so they began making slaveships. Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went He was in shock that in the mountains were black faces. Shot off their nose to impose what basically Still goes on today you see. If the truth is told the youth can grow. They'll learn to survive, until they gain control. Nobody says you have to be gangsters, hoes. Read more, learn more, change the globe. Ghetto children do your thing. Hold your head up, little man, you're a king. Young princess when you get your wedding ring, Your man is saying, "She's my queen!"

80@2Pac@Thugz Mansion@Tupac: Shit, tired of getting shot at Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested Niggas need a spot where we can kick it A spot where we belong, that's just for us Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood You na'mean? Where do niggas go when we die? Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G At Thug Mansion  Tupac: A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times I once contemplated suicide and would of tried But when I held that 9, all I could see was my moma's eyes No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you Picture me inside the misery of poverty No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived Praying hard for 'Better Dayz', promise to hold on Me and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on We finally found a spot to kick it Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at 'Thugz Mansion'  (Chorus: Anthony Hamilton) Ain't no place I'd rather be Children, dead homies and family Sky high, iced out paradise In the skyyyyyyyyyy.. Ain't no place I'd rather be Only place that's right for me Chromed out mansion in paradise In the skyyyyyyyyyy..  2Pac: Will I survive all the fights and the darkness? Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good for multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change? Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain? I need a place to rest my head with the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go How can I be peaceful?  I'm comin from the bottom Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape the deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion  Chorus  2Pac: Dear Mama don't cry, your baby boy's doing good Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook Drinking peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke Then some lady named Billie Holiday Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, 'til the day came Little LaTasha sure grown Tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us When Miles Davis cutting loose with the band Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last Picture a place that they exist, together There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking Remember this face, save me a place, in 'Thugz Mansion'  Chorus

86@Brooks and Dunn@Red Dirt Road@I was raised off of rural route 3 Out past where the blacktop ends We'd walk to church on Sunday morning And race barefoot back to Johnson's fence That's where I first saw Mary On that roadside pickin' blackberries That summer I turned the corner in my soul Down that red dirt road.  It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers (I heard) I've come to know there's life at both ends Of that red dirt road.  Her daddy didn't like me much In my shackled up GTO I'd sneak out in the middle of the night Throw rocks at her bedroom window We'd turn out the headlights And drive by the moonlight Talk about what the future might hold Down that red dirt road  It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers (I heard) I've come to know there's life at both ends Of that red dirt road.  I went out into the world And I came back in I lost Mary Oh, I got her back again And driving home tonight It feels like I found a long lost friend  It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers (I heard) I've come to know there's life at both ends Of that red dirt road.
87@Dierks Bentley@What was I Thinkin'@Becky was a beauty from south Alabama Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer Think he even did a little time in the slammer What was I thinkin'?  She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate What was I thinkin'?  Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay But that crossed my mind a little too late... 'cause I was...  Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right There in the middle by me I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get Goin' where a night might lead I know what I was feelin' But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'  By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field What was I thinkin'?  Out the other side she was hollerin' faster Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin' Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin' What was I thinkin'?  Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay But that crossed my mind a little too late... 'cause I was...  Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right There in the middle by me I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get Goin' where a night might lead I know what I was feelin' But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'  When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth We ran outside hood-slidin' like bo duke What was I thinkin'?  I finally got her home at a half past too late Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway Put it in park as he started my way What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'  Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin And like a bullet we were gone again... 'cause I was  Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right There in the middle by me I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get Goin' where a night might lead I know what I was feelin' But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'
88@Ruben Studdard@Flying without Wings@Everybody's looking for that something One thing that makes it all complete You'll find it in the strangest places Places you never knew it could be  Some find it in the faces of their children Some find it in their lover's eyes Who can deny the joy it brings When you find that special thing You're flying without wings  Some find it sharing every morning Some in their solitary lives You'll find it in the words of others A simple line can make you laugh or cry  You'll find it in the deepest friendships The kind you cherish all your life And when you know how much that means You have found that special thing You're flying without wings  So impossible as they may seem You've got to fight for every dream 'Cause who's to know which one you let go Would have made you complete  But for me, it's waking up beside you, yeah To watch the sun rise on your face To know that I can say "I love you" At any given time or place  It's the little things that only I know Those are the things that make you mine, all mine And it's the flying without wings 'Cause you're my special thing I'm flying without wings  You're the place my life begins And you'll be where it ends I'm flying without wings And that's the joy it brings I'm flying without wings
89@Eminem@Sing for the Moment@These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing  To see him walking around with his headphones blaring Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out  'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap  He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap His stepfather hit him so he socked him back And broke his nose, his house is a broken home There's no control, he just lets his emotions go  (Chorus fromAerosmith'sDream On) (Come on!)Sing with me,(Sing!)for the year(Sing it!) For the laughter, sing for the tear(Come on!) Sing it with me, if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangstas In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy, only have one homie Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me  Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make  Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen From standin' on corners and porches just rappin' To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass  But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you To get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad  So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly  But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense B  It's all political, if my music is literal And I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you  (Come on!)Sing with me, (Sing!) for the year (Sing that shit!) For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!) Sing it with me, if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued  See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus  But music is reflection of self, we just explain it And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it How we can come from practically nothing To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted  That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs  Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes  That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can  Sing with me,(Sing!)for the year(Sing it!)

90@Darryl Worley@Have you Forgotten?@(Darryl Worley/Wynn Varble)  I hear people saying we don't need this war I say there's some things worth fighting for What about our freedom and this piece of ground We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in Before you start your preaching let me ask you this my friend  Have you forgotten how it felt that day? To see your homeland under fire And her people blown away Have you forgotten when those towers fell? We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden Have you forgotten?  They took all the footage off my T.V. Said it's too disturbing for you and me It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say If it was up to me I'd show it everyday Some say this country's just out looking for a fight After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right  Have you forgotten how it felt that day? To see your homeland under fire And her people blown away   Have you forgotten when those towers fell? We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden Have you forgotten?  I've been there with the soldiers Who've gone away to war And you can bet that they remember Just what they're fighting for  Have you forgotten how it felt that day? To see your homeland under fire And her people blown away Have you forgotten when those towers fell? We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden Have you forgotten?  Have you forgotten all the people killed? Some went down like heros in that Pennsylvania field Have you forgotten about our Pentagon? All the loved ones that we lost and those left to carry on Don't you tell me not to worry about bin Laden Have you forgotten?  Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten?

96@Audioslave@Like a Stone@On a cobweb afternoon In a room full of emptiness By a freeway I confess I was lost in the pages Of a book full of death Reading how we'll die alone And if we're good we'll lay to rest Anywhere we want to go  In your house I long to be Room by room patiently I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone  And on my deathbed I will pray To the gods and the angels Like a pagan to anyone Who will take me to Heaven To a place I recall I was there so long ago The sky was bruised The wine was bled And there you led me on  In your house I long to be Room by room patiently I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone  And on I read Until the day was gone And I sat in regret Of all the things I've done For all that I've blessed And all that I've wronged In dreams until my death I will wander on  In your house I long to be Room by room patiently I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone
97@Norah Jones@Don't know Why@I waited till I saw the sun I don't know why I didn't come I left you by the house of fun I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come  When I saw the break of day I wished that I could fly away Instead of kneeling in the sand Catching teardrops in my hand  My heart is drenched in wine But you'll be on my mind forever  Out across the endless sea I will die in ecstasy But I'll be a bag of bones Driving down the road alone  My heart is drenched in wine But you'll be on my mind forever  Something has to make you run I don't know why I didn't come I feel as empty as a drum I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come
