Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling, can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride

How could you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (World is so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (I'm like my father, you know, you know he's too bold)

Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream, why?)
This is what it sounds like when doves cry
When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry

You must understand
That the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That is only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract

It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be

There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? Ooh

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

(What's love)got to do
Got to do do with it?
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

(What's love got to do)
Ooh, got to do do with it?
(What's love but a sweet second-hand emotion?)
What's love got to do got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

Been workin' so hard
I'm punchin' my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I've got

I got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I gotta cut loose
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You're playin' so cool
Obeyin' every rule
But dig way down in your heart
You're burnin', yearnin' for some

Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut loose
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Ooh-ee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah
(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah
(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah

First, we've got to turn you around
Second, and put your feet on the ground
Third, now take a hold of your soul
Ba, ba, ba
Ba!

I'm turnin' it loose!
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

(Footloose)Footloose(footloose), kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut

How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh-ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Well take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Now take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take

Take a look at me now

I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or loser

See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you - and that's the only way
Shake - shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than an
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Say you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only

You - lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than an
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

After my own indecision
They confused me so (Owner of a lonely heart)
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap (Owner of a lonely heart)
And don't you hesitate at all, no no
Yow!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than an
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than an
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart (Owner of a lonely heart)
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start (Owner of a lonely heart)

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all (Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it

There's the loving in your eyes all the way
If I listen to your lies would you say
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go
You come and go

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go
You come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green
Red, gold and green

Didn't hear your wicked words everyday
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
You string along

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go

Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold, and green

Everyday is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival

Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself
Ain't missing you

And they'll be carving you up alright

Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories

Time after sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow."
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
(I will be waiting)Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, "Go slow."
I fall behind

Hold me, I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me

Nobody does you like I do

When you close your eyes and you go to sleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things that you're dreaming about
When you open up your heart, and the truth comes out

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

When I hold you in my arms at night
Don't you know you're sleeping in the spotlight?
And all your dreams that you keep inside
You're telling me the secrets that you just can't hide

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

When you're talking in your sleep

When you close your eyes and you fall asleep
Everything about you is a mystery

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

Oh, the night is my world
City light painted girl
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall something's breaking
Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul

You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control

Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You help me to forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control

I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes

A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I have a picture
Pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and
We're laughing and loving it all

But look at our life now
All tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and
Delighting with tears
As we cry until dawn
Oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start)

You say I'm a dreamer
We're two of a kind
Both of us searching
For some perfect world
We know we'll never find

So perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, yeah, go far away
But you know that there's nowhere
That I'd rather be
Than with you here today
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start)

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start) whoa

You ask if I love you
Well, what can I say?
You know that I do
And that this is just one
Of those games that we play

So I'll sing you a new song
Please don't cry any more
I'll even ask your forgiveness
Though I don't know
Just what I'm asking it for
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
(Hold me in your loving arms)
Warm my heart
(Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me
(Ooohooohooo stay with me)
Let loving start

No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, it's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though oh, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you, yeah
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart

No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you

When I come home at night
I bang the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Or can the people on TV see me, or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there!
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of "Psycho" too much
That's why...

I sailed away to China
In a little row boat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no-one to hold you
What does that mean
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna to break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down, oh-no
I got to keep on movin'
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

You're on the road and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down, oh-no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on moving

Never let another girl like you, work me over
Never let another girl like you, drag me under
If I meet another girl like you, I will tell her
Never want another girl like you, have to say
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Oh-no, oh-no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch the ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Oh-no, oh-no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch the ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride

Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Und dass sowas von sowas kommt

Neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man fur Ufos aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so war
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Dusenflieger
Jeder war ein grosser Krieger
Hielten sich fur Captain Kirk
Es gab ein grosses Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fuhlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich fur schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: "Krieg!" und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hatte das gedacht
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig jahre Krieg
Liessen keinen Platz fur Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
Und auch keine Dusenflieger
Heute zieh ich meine Runden
Seh die Welt in Trummern liegen
Hab 'n Luftballon gefunden
Denk an dich und lass ihn fliegen

Even in the summer time
Everybody knows from the coy little wink
The girl's got a lot on her mind

She's got big thoughts, big dreams
And a big brown Mercedes sedan
What I think this girl,
She really wants is to be in love with a man

She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
But without love it ain't much

She saw him standing in the section marked
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie
She threw him bread and said make me scream
In the dark what could he say

Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said I need a man's man baby
Diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my head

She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
But without love it ain't much

They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to 55 Secret street
They made love and by the seventh wave
She knew she had a problem
She thought real love is real scary
Money only pays the rent
Love is forever that's all your life
Love is heaven sent it's glamorous

Lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
But without love it ain't much

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long
Before you and me run
To the place in our hearts
Where we hide

Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second
Without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever
I simply love you
More than I love life itself

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you

Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around

Just try to understand
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline

When you hold me in your arms
You love me till I just can't see

But then you let me down
When I look around
Baby, you just can't be found
Stop driving me away

There's something I just got to say

Watch you weave then breathe your story lines
And I wear my sunglasses at night

Keep track of the visions in my eyes

While she's deceiving me
It cuts my security
Has she got control of me?

Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades, oh no
Don't masquerade with the guy in shades, oh no
I can't believe it
'Cause you got it made with the guy in shades, oh no

I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, so I can
Forget my name while you collect your claim

See the light that's right before my eyes

I'm all out of hope
One more bad break
Could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release

(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a face

I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you

(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a face

When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas, oh, the gigolo cool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down, oh

I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, tryin' to stay hip
I'm thinkin' of you, you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once
So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realize

(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a face
Such a human waste
Your eyes without a face

We weren't so straight and narrow
This is much more than we deserve

A higher voice has called the tune
Two hearts that lost the beat will now resume
The gift of life extension
By divine intervention

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that Heaven can wait
Telling me to get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we've found
The second time around

Don't understand what's going on
Woke up this morning, all the hurt was gone
This is a new beginning
I'm back in the land of the living

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that Heaven can wait
And I gotta get it right this time

Is something everyone should see

All dressed so scantily

You got until it's gone
And I found out too little too late

You were lucky to have me
Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there

But then you were gone
And it all was wrong
Had no idea
How much I cared

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to

Being without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take

I'm addicted to you, baby
You're a hard habit to break

You found someone else
You had every reason
You know I can't blame you
For running to him

Two people together
But living alone
I was spreading
My love too thin

After all of these years
I'm still trying to be shaken
Doing much better
They say that it just takes time

But deep in the night
It's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

He went to dance with someone else.

We started dancing and love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new

(We were running) Whoa
(Running with the night)

You were looking so good, girl, heads were turning
You and me on the town, ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were burning
We were gonna go all the way and we never had a doubt

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I till the morning light
(We were running) Whoa
(Running with the night)

We were so in love, you and me
On the boulevard, wild and free
Giving all we got, we laid it down
Taking every shot, we took the town

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, girl, it was so right, so right
(Running with the night)

Just you and I
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, girl, it was so right
(Running with the night)
Girl it was so right

54@Elton John@Sad Songs (Say So Much)
@@@
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much

Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all a little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all a little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say...

Yeah-eah!

I want a new drug
One that won't make me sick
One that won't make me crash my car
Or make me feel three feet thick

I want a new drug
One that won't hurt my head
One that won't make my mouth too dry
Or make my eyes too red

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you

I want a new drug
One that won't spill
One that don't cost too much
Or come in a pill

I want a new drug
One that won't go away
One that won't keep me up all night
One that won't make me sleep all day

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do
One that makes me feel like I feel when I'm with you
When I'm alone with you
I'm alone with you, baby

I want a new drug
One that does what it should
One that won't make me feel too bad
One that won't make me feel too good

I want a new drug
One with no doubt

Or make my face break out

One that won't make me nervous
Wondering what to do

Love is a battlefield
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're begging me go then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know, do I stand in your way?
Or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your side

We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand(Ha, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)

We're losing control, will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand(Ha, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
No promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield

Caught me down like a killer shark
It's like a railroad running right through my heart
Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave
Feel like I'm running on an empty gauge

Oh no not again
It hurts so good
I don't understand

And the locker slam
On the plan you had tonight

You've been messing around
With a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know
Could put you right

In the lot, the boy that's idling by
Doesn't rev your heart
Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you

And the long halls
And the gray walls
Are gonna split apart
Believe it or not
There's life after high school

And that's why the student body
Got a bad reputation

What they need is adult education
You're back to school, it's a bad situation
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
But what you want
Is an adult education

Oh yeah

To deal with the student body
And the underclassmen are
Flashing hot and cool

You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number
Memories that you won't remember

So you got a little education
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it'll rub off on you

The boys are busy in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember

The senior with the junior miss
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Adult education
Adult education, adult education
It's a bad situation, adult education

Adult, adult, adult, adult education
Adult education, oh yeah, oh yeah

Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by

Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie

I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But I'm not above making up for the love
You've been denying you can ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can

Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man

I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am

Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before

Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that's easier
To hate than to wait anymore

I know you don't wanna hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there and if I can survive
I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I'm not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me, I'll understand

Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man

I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am
An innocent man

You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision
But I'm not below anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began

Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man

I am an innocent man

Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're going for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playing 'round, boy that's just fine

Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

Do what you do to me
You've got me burning up
Whoohoohoohoo, ahw!
I think you get to me
I've got to give it up
Whoohoohoohoo, ahw!

I'm all confused and I don't know what to do
'Cause I still can't get over lovin' you
I've had a time when I can't you off my mind
No, I still can't get over lovin' you

Every time I run into your friends
I just have to ask them with who and where you've been
And when they tell me what I really didn't want to know
It only breaks my heart, it makes me want you more

When I hear your name, I get going insane
'Cause I still can't get over lovin' you
I can't turn you loose, though I know it's self-abuse
I still can't get over lovin' you

Now I've tried to get involved with someone new
But it's just no use, 'cause I expect them to be like you, baby
I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause every girl I date resembles you

Oh, help me, baby, I'm goin' crazy
I still can't get over lovin' you
No, oh, it's tearin' my heart apart
'Cause I still can't get over lovin' you

Girl, I'm so sad and it hurts me so bad
Knowin' you're with someone else (Someone else), oh
Though I have no right to be, I'm filled with jealousy
'Cause I want you for myself

And I'm not blamin' you, naw, baby
It's not your fault if you feel the way I do
And even though I wish that you'd still love me
It still won't change the way I feel for you

Girl, I can't forget 'cause it's not over yet
I still can't get over lovin' you
Every breath you take, I'll be watchin' you, girl
'Cause I still can't get over lovin' you, mmm

(Lovin' you) There's no way that this thing is through, no
(I still can't get over) Not yet, I ain't through lovin' you
I'm gettin' mad (Lovin' you), girl, don't you ever try to leave, no, no

It's close to midnight, and something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause it's a thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a, killer, thriller tonight, yeah

You hear the door slam, and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while, you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time

'Cause it's a thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
(Thriller, thriller night)
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side (boom!)
They will possess you, unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time, for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night, I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Thriller, thriller night)
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller thriller here tonight

'Cause it's a thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Thriller, thriller night)
So let me hold you tight and share a (Killer, thriller)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Middle of the night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Middle of the night, babe

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty-thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs

Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China so finish what you got

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these

Strange days indeed -- strange days indeed

Everybody's runnin' and no one makes a move
Everyone's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Katmandu

Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in the movies you just gotta lay around

Nobody told me there'd be days like these

Been running so fast

So long to play this part

On R&R from Cuba and Russia
The smell of sex, the smell of suicide
All these things I can't keep inside

Undercover
Keep it all out of sight
Undercover of the night

Undercover of the night

Undercover
Undercover
Undercover of the night

Shake up the picture the lizard mixture
With your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers
All of which I deny

I said it again
But could I please rephrase it
Maybe I can catch a ride
I couldn't really put it much plainer
But I'll wait 'til you decide

Send me your warning siren
As if I could ever hide
Last time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

Breaking away with the best of both worlds
A smile that you can't disguise
And every minute I keep finding
Clues that you leave behind

Save me from these reminders
As if I'd forget tonight
This time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

I light my torch and wave it for the

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
(Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

(I light my torch and wave it for the)

New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
(Fire dance through the night)

Standing there alone
The ship is waiting
All systems are go
"Are you sure?"
Control is not convinced
But the computer
Has the evidence
No need to abort
The countdown starts

Watching in a trance
The crew is certain
Nothing left to chance
All is working
Trying to relax
Up in the capsule
"Send me up a drink"
Jokes Major Tom
The count goes on

Four, three, two, one
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Calling, calling home

Second stage is cut
We're now in orbit
Stabilizers up
Running perfect
Starting to collect
Requested data
"What will it affect
When all is done?"
Thinks Major Tom

Back at ground control
There is a problem
"Go to rockets full"
Not responding
"Hello, Major Tom
Are you receiving?
Turn the thrusters on
We're standing by"
There's no reply

Four, three, two, one
Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Calling, calling home

Across the stratosphere
A final message
"Give my wife my love"
Then nothing more

Far beneath the ship
The world is mourning
They don't realize
He's alive
No one understands
But Major Tom sees
"Now the light commands
This is my home
I'm coming home"

Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Coming home

Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Coming home

Earth below us
Drifting, falling
Floating weightless
Coming, coming

Summer
It turns me upside down
Summer, summer, summer
It's like a merry-go-round

I see you under the midnight
All shackles and bows
The high shoes with the cleats a-clicking
A temperamental glow
How could you let me go?

Oh, I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
I've got a hold on you tonight

Oh, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(Got a hold on you)
That's right

(Uh oh, it's magic)
When I'm with you(I know it's magic)
(Uh oh, it's magic)
Just a little magic
You know it's true
I got a hold on you

Oh, twisted
Under, sideways, down
I know you're getting twisted
And you can't calm down

I see you under the midnight
Love darts in your eyes
How far can you take it
Till you realize
There's magic in your eyes?

I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
Got a hold on you tonight

I got a hold on you
Got a hold on you
(Got a hold on you)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Uh oh, when I'm with you(I know it's magic)
(Uh oh, it's magic)
Uh oh, it's magic

Just a little bit of
Magic pulls me through
I got a hold on you

I've got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(I got a hold on you)
That's right, it's magic

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Uh oh, it's magic
When I'm with you
Uh oh

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Just a little magic
Inside of you
Oh

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Takes a little bit of magic
That's true
When I'm with you

(Uh oh, it's magic)
Gotta be magic
Your magic pulls me through

98@Night Ranger@When You Close Your Eyes
@@@
What do you do when it's falling apart
And you knew it was gone from the very start
Do you close your eyes and dream about me

A girl in love with a gleam in her eye
I was a younger boy all dressed in white
We're older now, Do you still think about me

I remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet
Well it felt so good to be young, feels like yesterday

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
Do you still dream about me

I guess I don't know what I'm thinking
Coming off a hard night of drinking
Angie come closer to me, I need a soul to bleed on

It coulda been done in a different kinda way
But that ain't you, you play tough when you play
It's over now, I bet you still think about me

I remember I held you so tight
And we danced the night away
With the moves of two wide-eyed kids
I need you so much today

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

I remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet
No good for an old memory, to mean so much today

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you go to sleep at night, do you dream about me

I'm rockin' tonite, I'm walkin' on air
Gonna find me some trouble, gonna grab my share
I want you tonight, I want ya with me
Make me guilty of love in the first degree, yeah

(You want it all right)We're goin' in style
Say you walk right--you talk right--and your hair's so wild
(Snow-white)Hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between

Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment, leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion, set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near

Take me in your arms
Roll me through the night
Take me to your heart
Rock me tonite

(You do it all right)You're passion to see
You been schooled in the arts of romancin' me
(Hold tight)You're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside

No one's stopping us now
We go down, down where the music's loud
(It's all night)Hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love, play it all for me

Life's never easy, we can make it if we try
Takin' our chances, side by side
Live for the moment, on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be

Take me in your arms
Roll me through the night
Take me to your heart
Rock me tonite

Take me in your arms
It's alright(it's alright)
Take me to your heart
Rock me tonite

A time for all and all in time
A step beyond the borderline
Of who we are and where we long to be, yeah
Every night you hear the sound
Of wakin' up and breakin' down
You find a chance and heave it all away

Come on, babe
Take me in your arms
Roll me through the night
Take me to your heart
Rock me tonite

Take me in your arms
It's alright(it's alright)
Take me to your heart, come and take me
Rock me tonite

Take me in your arms
Turn me to the light
Take me to your heart
Rock me, rock, rock, rock 'n roll me
Rock, rock, rock 'n roll me
It's alright
