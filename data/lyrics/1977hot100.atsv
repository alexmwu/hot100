Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax baby and draw that blind

Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen off that pretty French gown
Let me pour you a good long drink
Ooh baby, don't you hesitate 'cause

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

C'mon angel my hearts on fire
Don't deny your man's desire
You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Don't say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you woman
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

For so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong, girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

Darling, mine
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
Build my world around you, darling
This love will shine, girl
Watch it and see
If you give a little more than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the Heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string

Oh, if I, if I stay here without you, darling, I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything
To be your everything

Darling, for so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more then strong, girl

Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be

ANGEL IN YOUR ARMS

Do you think I'm such a fool to believe everything you say is true
That just goes to show
That you really don't know

While you're out paintin' the town
Do you think I'm home just sittin' around waitin' on you
Now who's really the fool

When I first found out  I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find

That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Why'd you slip around secretly
If you were tired of loving me
Why'd you keep holdin' on  when love was already gone

The times you said you weren't feelin' well
Did you think I couldn't tell you'd been with someone else
You were only kiddin' yourself

When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find

That the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Yes the angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine.
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine.
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight.
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light.

I see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshine.
We've walked along St. Thomas beach a million times.
Hand in hand, two barefoot lovers kissing in the sand.
Side by side, the tide rolls in.
I'm touching you, you're touching me.
If only it could be.

I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine.
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine.
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight.
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light.

Through each dream, how our love has grown.
I see us with our children and our happy home.
Little smiles, so warm and tender looking up at us.
Blessed by love, the one we shared
Till I wake, and reach for you,
And you're just not there.

I like dreamin' 'cause dreaming can make you mine.
I like holding you close and touching your skin
Even if it's in my mind.
Oh, sweet dream baby, I love you.
Oh, my sweet dream baby, you're in my dreams every night.
Oh sweet dreams, I like feelin you
Oh sweet dreams baby, Don't keep me waiting all my life.

Without your love, oh baby

Don't leave me this way, now
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss, don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now, come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul

Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
Then come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Set me free, set me free

Don't, don't you leave me this way, no
Don't you understand, I'm at your command?
Oh baby, please, please don't leave me this way, no, baby

Satisfy the need in me, satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me

Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend

And he never showed his face again

Ohh I'm so glad I finally found you
You're that one in a million man
When you wrap your lovin' arms around me
I can stand up and face the world again

Your love is liftin' me higher

Crying on my pillow, lonely in my bed
Then I heard a voice beside me and she softly said
Wonder is your night light, magic is your dream
And as I held her, she said, see what I mean

I said what?
She said oo-oo-oo wee
I said all right
She said love me, love me, love me

Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there
(Somewhere)Yeah, somewhere

Heavenly surrender, sweet afterglow(undercover)
I'm givin' up my heart to you, now angel don't go
She said, go find the right one, love her and then(undercover)
When you look into her eyes, you'll see me again

I said what?
She said oo-oo-oo wee

Now you know my story and, girl, if it's right
I'm gonna take you in my arms and love you tonight
Underneath the covers, the answer lies
I'm lookin' for my angel in your sweet lovin' eyes

She said what?
I said oo-oo-oo wee

There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

Torn between two lovers

Feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance

And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh-ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance

And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen

Nibblin' on sponge cake
Watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with oil
Strummin' my six string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my long lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault

Don't know the reason
Stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here, I haven't a clue

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now, I think, hell, it could be my fault

I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's my own damn fault
Yes, some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know it's my own damn fault

Sometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon,
Lose all their meaning with the rising moon.
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true,
Answer the question I must ask of you .....

Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down,
If you try and fool yourself.
Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously,
Or take it somewhere else.

Take all the freedom that a lover will allow,
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now.
Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep,
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep.

Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down,
If you try and fool yourself.
Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously,
Or take it somewhere else.

If you wanna get close to me,
You could do it so easily.
Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes,
Or just another empty lie?

Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands

But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget:
For there'sBasie,Miller,Satchmo
And the king of all,Sir Duke
And with a voice likeElla's ringin' out
There's no way the band could lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all over, all over people

Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people

Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night
Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when you close your eyes
I apologize to anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies?
It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through your soul
Like the stories of old

Old man, he and his dog
They walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da........

Mysteries like this and
Many others in the trees
Blow in the night in the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da........

I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be travelin' forever
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do

When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you, babe
It's only a heartbeat away

It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be travelin' a lifetime
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do
Oh, I need you

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keepin' me warm night and day

When I need you
I just close my eyes
And you're right here by my side
Keepin' me warm night and day

I just hold out my hands
I just hold out my hands
And I'm with you darlin'
Yes, I'm with you darlin'

And all I want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away
Oh, I need you darlin'
Oh, I want you

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just one night
It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know
We can still come through

I really lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left
Even so

Don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are?
The angel and the dreamer
Who sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us, I know
We can still come through

It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby

Down in Jamaica they got lots of pretty women
Steal your money, then they break your heart
Lonesome Sue, she's in love with old Sam
Take him from the fire into the frying pan

On and on, she just keeps on trying
And she smiles when she feels like crying
On and on, on and on, on and on

Poor old Jimmy sits alone in the moonlight
Saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder, steals the stars from the sky
Puts on Sinatra and starts to cry

On and on, he just keeps on trying
And he smiles when he feels like crying
On and on, on and on, on and on

When the first time is the last time
It can make you feel so bad
But if you know it, show it
Hold on tight, don't let her say good night

Got the sun on my shoulders and my toes in the sand
A woman's left me for some other man
Aw, but I don't care, I'll just dream and stay tan
Toss up my heart to see where it lands

On and on, I just keep on trying
And I smile when I feel like dying
On and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on

Spent my time so foolishly

Restless feeling really got a hold

No, I couldn't see the light

Couldn't get it right

There you are
Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you

Do you love him
As much as I love her?
And will that love be strong
When old feelings start to stir?

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way
To another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories

And if I hold you
For the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go?

Oh no, we made it
Left each other on the way
To another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Oh, we made it

Play the way you feel it

Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
They say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Now here I go again
I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost

Ooh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing

In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her she said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after what-ever the other life brings

In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
Had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille

After he left us I ordered more whisky
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her 'cos the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille ...

She helped me with my suitcase

I wanna wrap myself around you.

Til the passion starts to rise.

I wanna take you to heaven.
That would make my day complete.

Well that's enough for me.

Sometimes when you're asleep
And I'm just starin' at the ceiling,
I wanna reach out and touch you,
But you just go on dreamin'.

No one's comin', no one's gonna telephone
Just me and you and the lights down low

And we're slow dancin', swayin' to the music
Slow dancin', just me and my girl

Shadows dancin' all across the wall
Music's playin' so soft and slow
Rest of the world so far away and small

When we're slow dancin', swayin' to the music
Slow dancin', just me and my girl
Slow dancin', swayin' to the music

Hold me, oh, oh, oh, hold me
No, never let me go

As we dance together in the dark
So much love in this heart of mine
You whisper to me, hold you tight
You're the one I thought I'd never find

Now we're slow dancin', swayin' to the music

He was born on a summer day, 1951
And with a slap of a hand, he had landed as an only son
His mother and father said, "What a lovely boy
We'll teach him what we learned, ah, yes, just what we learned
We'll dress him up warmly, and we'll send him to school
It'll teach him how to fight, to be nobody's fool"

Oh, oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

In the summer of '53, his mother brought him a sister
And she told him, "We must attend to her needs
She's so much younger than you"
Well, he ran down the hall and he cried
Oh, how could his parents have lied?
When they said he was their only son
He thought he was their only one

Oh, oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy
Oh, what a lonely boy

He left home on a winter day, 1969
And he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time
Well, his sister grew up, and she married a man
He gave her a son, ah, yes, a lovely son
They dressed him up warmly, they sent him to school
It taught him how to fight, to be nobody's fool

Oh, oh, what a lonely boy

Lookin' back on when I was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside!"
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her from woopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's tellin' 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, an' I'll give you anythin' you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy, after church is through

Smokin' cigarettes, writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy!)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?

A name whisper game

And if the real thing don't do the trick

You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, barracuda

"Dive down deep, now, save my head"

All that night and all the next
Swam without lookin' back
Made for the western pools

Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins, dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask or is it cool, is it cool?

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

And it's a good time for me
To head on down the line

Heard it in a love song

I'm the kinda man likes to get away
Like to start dreaming about
Tomorrow, today
Never said that I love you
Even though it's so
Where's that duffel bag of mine?
It's time to go

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm gonna be leaving
At the break of dawn
Wish you could come
But I don't need no woman tagging along
I'll sneak out that door
Couldn't stand to see you cry
I'd stay another year if I saw teardrops in your eyes

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I never had a damn thing, but what I had
I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing
I ever tried to get off my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder
And I guess I always will

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Ahh
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high

Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
No!

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, none can equal the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry (Don't you cry no more)

No more

Face to face, I just seem to go dry
But I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high

Thanks for taking me (thanks for taking me)
On a one way trip to the sun (one way trip to the sun)
And thanks for turning me (turning me)
Into a someone (someone)

And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry

And I know that my song isn't saying anything new
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you

You know I got to be moving on

Oh, big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away

Goodbye to all my friends at home
Goodbye to people I've trusted

As I get on the 707
Riding high, I got tears in my eyes
You know you got to go through hell before you get to heaven

Don't carry me too far away
Oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Touching down in New England town
Feel the heat coming down
I've got to keep on keeping on
You know the big wheel keeps a-spinning around
And I'm going with some hesitation
You know that I can surely see
That I don't want to get caught up in any of that
Funky shit going down in the city

Don't carry me too far away

Chorus
Stand Tall, don't you fall oh, don't go and do something foolish

Stand Tall, don't you fall. don't go do something you'll regret later

Never lasted so long
Or through so much - or through so many
I just can't believe I could throw it all away

Sometimes late at night
when there's nothing here except my old piano
I'd almost give my hands to make you see my way

Chorus
Stand Tall, don't you fall oh, don't go and do something foolish

And tell me

When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?

Time in New England took me away
To long rocky beaches and you by the bay
We started a story whose end must now wait
And tell me
When will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again?

I feel the change coming, I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring, I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out all the love that I had

And you pulled the rug right out from under my life
I know where you goin' to, I knew when you came home last night

Lord, I was stunned, shoulda seen it come a long time ago

If things are the same, then explain why your kiss is so cold
And that mist in your eyes feels like rain on the fire in my soul

This lyin' and cryin' is upsettin' and gettin' nowhere
It don't stack up, so slack up, then pack up, I just don't care
Don't let the screen door hit you on your way out
Don't you drown when your dreamboat runs onto the ground

By filling his glass with your fast-flowing bittersweet lime
You'll face the aftertaste when you come home late some night
With your eyes all a-mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Way on the other side of the Hudson,
deep in the bosom of suburbia,
I met a young girl, she sang mighty fine,
Tears on My Pillow and Ave Maria.
Standing by the waterfall in Paramus Park
she was working for the Friends-of-BAI
She was collecting quarters in a paper cup.
She was looking for change and so was I.

She was a Jewish girl. I fell in love with her.
She wrote her number on the back of my hand.
I called her up, I was all out of breath, I said,
"Come hear me play in my rock and roll band.
I took a shower and I put on my best blue jeans.
I picked her up in my new VW van.
She wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath.
I said, "Hi". She said, "Yeah, I guess I am."

Ariel'

We had a little time, we were real hungry.
We went to Dairy Queen for something to eat.
She had some onion rings. She had a pickle.
She forgot to tell me that she didn't eat meat.
I had a gig in the American Legion Hall.
It was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corp.
She was sitting in a corner against the wall.
She would smile and I melted all over the floor.

Ariel'

I took her home with me. We watched some TV,
Annette Funicello and some guy going steady.
I started fooling around with the vertical hold.
We got the munchies and I made some spaghetti.
We sat and we talked into the night,
while channel 2 was signing off the air.
I found the softness of her mouth.
We made love to bombs bursting in Arrrrrriel'.

Life without you isn't worth the trouble of
I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel
A touch without a feel
I can't believe it's real

But someday soon I'll wake
And find my heart won't have to break

Yes, I'm lost without your love

I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on (ch-ch)

So pull on your jeans and come on out with me

I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me

You and me, we'll go motorbike riding
In the sun and the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket, got a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again

I'll meet ya in the usual place
I don't need a thing except your pretty face

Lido missed the boat that day, he left the shack
But that was all he missed, and he ain't comin' back
At a tombstone bar in a juke joint car, he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top

Next stop, Chi-town, Lido put the money down, let it roll
He said, "One more job oughta get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One for the road"

Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's a-waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
He said, "One more job oughta get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road"

Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun until he got the note
Saying, "Tow the line or blow it," and that was all she wrote
He be makin' like a beeline headin' for the border line, goin' for broke
Sayin', "One more hit oughta do it
This joint, ain't nothin' to it
One more for the road"

Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's a-waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

One last shot, then we quit it
One more for the road"

And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Now I'm hanging on
Maybe you can tell me

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong

Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling

I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
It isn't really fair

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling

Hand me down my walkin' cane
Hand me down my hat
Hurry now and don't be late
'Cause we ain't got time to chat
You and me, we're goin' out
To catch the latest sound
Guaranteed to blow your mind
So high you won't come down

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Oh, this dude is outta sight
Everything he does
Seems to come out right

Once I went to hear them play
At a club outside of town
I was so surprised, I was hypnotized
By the sound this cat put down
When I saw this short, fat guy
Stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard
'Cause the man got down
When he finally reached his goal

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Got that rubber band
Up on his toes
And then he wriggled it up
All around his nose

Guaranteed to blow your mind
Playin' all that music, yet keepin' time
Where in the world did he learn that, oh, Lord
Lord, help him get away

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband man, rubberband man
How much of this stuff do he think we can stand?
So much rhythm, grace, and debonair for one man, Lord
And then he had the nerve to twiggle his left toe
Slip it through his knee, got the feeling in his head, y'all
Aw, come on, baby

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband man starts to jam
Moving up and down cross the land
Got the people all in his wake
Everything probably seems outta place

Just move it, just move it
Just move, move, move it
Just, rubberband, rubberband man
Just move it, just move it
Just move, move, move it
Just, rubberband, rubberband man
Get down
Oh, get down low

If there is a tear on my face

And you know I never cry, I never cry

Sometimes I drink more than I need
Until the TV's dead and gone
I may be lonely
But I'm never alone
And the night may pass me by
But I'll never cry

Take away, take away my eyes
Sometimes I'd rather be blind
Break a heart, break a heart of stone
Open it up but don't you leave it alone

'Cuz that's all I got to give you
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried
And you know I'll never cry
And you know I'll never cry
And you know I'll never cry
Never cry, I'll never cry

Break a heart, break a heart of stone
Open it up but don't leave, don't you leave me alone

But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?

The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you

That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flying up in the air
A-sing "Hey, Diddle Diddle" with your kitty in the middle
At the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Then I knowed love was here to stay

Walk this way, walk this way

Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss a-like this

On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress
Running like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue-tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat

Well, she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat

Well, morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drumbeat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the newborn day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're gonna stay
In the year of the cat

(Party night) settle down with the sounds of the music
(Boogie night) music, music

(Boogie nights) feel so right when you got the feeling
(Boogie nights) hold you tight get to keep on dealing
Dance with the boogie get down
(Dance with the boogie get down)
'Cause boogie nights are always the best in town

Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing

(Boogie nights, ohh)
Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing
(Boogie nights, ohh)
Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing

(Boogie nights, ohh)
If you wanna boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie nights
(Boogie nights, ohh)
If you wanna boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie nights
(Boogie nights, ohh)
If you wanna boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie nights
(Boogie nights, ohh)
If you wanna boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie nights
(Boogie nights, ohh)
If you wanna boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie nights

Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up's all you want to do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day

You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way

What do I got to do to make you love me?
What do I got to do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And awake to find that you are not there

What do I got to do to make you want me?
What do I got to do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad (so sad) so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad (so sad) so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do to make you love me?
What do I got to do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I got to do?
What have I got to do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word

Well, it's been building up inside of me
For, oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinkin'
Somethings bound to go wrong

But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
When she says
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
(Baby)

Each morning I awake and fine
The sunlight softly shining in her hair
And then I realize that I'm only
Thinkin' that she really doesn't care
There's magic in her eyes
That makes me come alive
When she says

(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby

She told me Baby, when you leave today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says

(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Everything will turn out alright
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
(Don't worry baby)
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you

We just have to face it, this time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

Mem'ries (Memories), good days (Good days)
Bad days (Bad days)
They'll be (They'll be), with me (With me)
Always

In these old familiar rooms children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you

We just have to face it, this time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you

We just have to face it, this time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

How much love do you need
Before you give your love to me
How much time before it grows
How much love I wanna know

What can I do what can I say
The last thing I want is to drive you away
How much love does it take
How much love for heaven sake

How much love how much love
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate
How much love how much love how much love

Am I tryin' too hard
Give me some kind of clue
There must be a way to get through to you
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate
Do I rush right in or do I wait

How much love how much love
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate
How much love how much love how much love

I got so much love
Don't know where to begin
I'm pleadin' with you babe
You gotta let me in
