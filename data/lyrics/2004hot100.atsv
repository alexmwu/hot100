51@Switchfoot@Meant to Live@Fumbling his confidence and wondering why the world has passed him by. Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments and failed attempts to fly, to fly.  We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside  Dreaming about providence and whether mice and men have second tries. Maybe we've been living with our eyes half open, maybe we're bent and broken, broken.  We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? Somewhere we live inside  We want more than this world's got to offer We want more than this world's got to offer We want more than the wars of our fathers And everything inside screams for second life.  Yeah  We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves? We were meant to live for so much more Have we lost ourselves?  We were meant to live. We were meant to live.

93@Keith Urban@You'll Think of Me@I woke up early this morning around 4a.m. With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms I've been trying my best to get along But that's okay there's nothing left to say but.  Take your records, take you freedom Take your memories, I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.  I went out driving, trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been. So.  Take your records, take you freedom Take your memories, I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me.  Someday I'm gonna run across your mind Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I'll be over you And on with my life.  Take your records, take you freedom Take your memories, I don't need 'em And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me.  Take your records, take you freedom Take your memories, I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater 'Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.  And you're gonna think of me Oh, someday baby, someday...

100@Kenny Chesney@I Go Back@Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along 'Cause every time I hear that song.  I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy Driving my first love out to the levee Livin' life with no sense of time I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks Every time I hear that song, I go back I go back.  Well, I used to rock all night long To Keep On Rocking Me, Baby At frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along 'Cause everytime I hear that song.  I go back to the smell of an old gym floor The taste of salt on a Carolina shore After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall Growin' up too fast and I do recall Wishing time would stop right in it's tracks Everytime I hear that song, I go back I go back.  We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives That takes us to another place and time.  So, I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire And the smell of Sunday chicken after church I go back to the loss of a real good friend And the sixteen summers I shared with him Now, Only The Good Die Young stops me in my tracks Everytime I hear that song, I go back I go back.  To the feel of a fifty yard line A blanket, a girls, and some raspberry wine I go back To watching summer fade to fall Growing up too fast and I do recall I go back To the loss of a real good friend And the sixteen summers I shared with him I go back. I go back...
