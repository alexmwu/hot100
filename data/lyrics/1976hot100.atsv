You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that? I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

(I love you) I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, now can't you see?
(I love you) Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see?
What's wrong with that? I need to know
'Cause here I go again

I love you
I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly
Love isn't silly at all

How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
(I love you) How can I tell you about my loved one?
(I love you) How can I tell you about my loved one?

I love you
I love you
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?)
I love you (Ah, he gave me more, he gave it all to me, say can't you see?)
I love you (I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?) (How can I tell you about my loved one?)

You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh no
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?

Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
Hey, my
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night

Oh, I
Got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
Hey, my
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night(Do do do do do, do do do do)

Hey
Do it now
Yeah, hey

Hey, yeah, once I was a boogie singer
Playin' in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burnin' down the one night stands

And everything around me, yeah
Got to start to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly, yes, I did
To disco down and check out the show

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, yeah, yeah

Well, I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish, how could I
To not see I was the one behind?

So still I kept on fightin'
Well, loosin' every step of the way
I said, "I must go back there", got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

Yeah, they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die

Till you die, oh, till you die
Come on, play some electrified funky music

Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy
Changin' rock and rollin' minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind

Oh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better
I'm funkin' out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin', no I won't
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, oh till you die

This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you anymore
Because of my obligations and the ties that you have

We've been meeting here everyday
And since this is our last day together
I wanna hold you just one more time

When you turn and walk away, don't look back
I wanna remember you just like this
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do

We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done, oh was wrong
Please darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

Many months have passed us by
(I'm gonna miss you)
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
I've got ties and so do you
I just think this is the thing to do

It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
Maybe you'll meet, you'll meet another guy
Understand me, won't you try, try, try, try, try, try, try
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

Hmm(I'm gonna miss you)
I'm gonna miss you, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)
Understand me, won't you try
(I'm gonna miss you)
It's gonna hurt me, I can't lie
(I'm gonna miss you)

Take my handkerchief, wipe your eyes
(I'm gonna miss you)
Maybe you'll find, you'll find another guy
(I'm gonna miss you)
Let's kiss and say goodbye, pretty baby
(I'm gonna miss you)
Please, don't you cry

Understand me, won't you try

"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me.
"The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover."

She said, "It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover."
50 ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free

Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free

Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

She said, "It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again."
I said, "I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways?"

She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover
50 ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free

Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just get yourself free

Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much

Won't you smile a while for me, Sara?

If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow?

Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right."
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everythings a little clearer in the light of day?
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?

Thinkin 'bout you's working up my appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught that didn't bite
But you got some bait a-waiting and I think I might
Like nibblin' a little afternoon delight

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun goes down

Thinkin' of you's workin' up a' appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting

And I wrote some rock 'n' roll so you can move
Music fills your heart

No escape from reality

Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)

Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, making love to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, angel?
How did you know I'd be the one?
Did you know you're everything I prayed for?
Did you know, every night and day for?
Every day, needing love as satisfaction
Now you're lying next to me, giving it to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Oh, kiss me, you sexy thing
Touch me, baby, you sexy thing
I love the way you touch me, darling, you sexy thing
Oh, it's ecstasy, you sexy thing

Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart, not tough
Or strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not fooling me

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh...

The moon'll send you on your way, ha-ha

We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smiling bright
I'll play the radio on Southern stations
'Cause Southern belles are hell at night
You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
A class of 7-4 gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again, ha-ha

Moonlight
Feels right

We'll see the sun come up on Sunday morning
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm giving you a warning
'Cause me and moon are itching to play

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Living alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore

you put me in such an awful spin
in a spin

I love to love you baby

Lay your head down so close to
soothe my mind and set me free
set me free

I love to love you baby

When you're laying so close to me
there's no place I'd rather you be
than with me here

I love to love you baby

I will love you any way
Even if you can not stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy ya
Though you're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

Woah oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything
Whah oh sweet thing
Oh you know you're my everything
Yes you are

I wish you were my lover
But you act so undercover
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right
Or be it wrong
I'm only what you make me baby
Don't walk away don't be so shady
Don't want your mind
Don't want your money
These words I say they may sound funny
But

Woah oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything
Woah oh sweet thing
Boy you know you're my everything
Yes you are

Yes you are

Ooh
You are my heat you are my fire
You make me weak with strong desire
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right
Or be it wrong
I just want to satisfy you
Though you're not mine
I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

You're the heat
You are the fire
You're not mine
I cant deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazy

When your body's had enough of me

When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more

Come on over here and lay by my side
I've got to be touchin' you
Let me rub your tired shoulders
The way I used to do

Look into my eyes and give me that smile
The one that always turns me on
And let me take your hair down
'Cause we're stayin' up to greet the sun

Got to say a few things that have been on my mind
And you know where my mind has been
I guess I learned my lessons
And now's the time to begin

So if you're feelin' alright and you're ready for me
I know that I'm ready for you
We better get it on now

Another day is at end
Mama says she's tired again
No one can even begin to tell her
I hardly know what to say
But maybe it's better that way
If Papa were here I'm sure he'd tell her

Shannon is gone, I hope she's drifting out to sea
She always loved to swim away
Maybe she'll find an island with a shaded tree
Just like the one in our backyard

Mama tries hard to pretend
Things will get better again
Somehow she's keeping it all inside her
But finally the tears fill our eyes
And I know that somewhere tonight
She knows how much we really miss her

Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringin'

So help me help me,
Help me make the feeling grow.

'Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Have pity, baby, just,
When I thought it was over,
And now you got me runnin', runnin',
Runnin' for cover.

I'm begging you for, a bit of
Sympathy,
If you use me again,
It'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Baby, baby hope,
You're gonna stay away,
'Cause I'm getting weaker,
Weaker every day.

I guess I'm not as strong,
As I used to be,
If you use me again,
It'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the lovin' starts and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Good morning yesterday
You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find
The memories you left behind
Remember
Do you remember

The laughter and the tears
The shadows of misty yesteryears
The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember
Do you remember the times of your life (do you remember)

Reach back for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
For memories are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow

Here comes the setting sun
The seasons are passing one by one
So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life

Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life

I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me, a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Stay away
Look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman

And left 'em settin' on the scales

By the time we hit that Chi-town
Them bears was a-gettin' smart
They'd brought up some reinforcements
From the Illinois National Guard

There's armored cars and tanks and jeeps
And rigs of ev'ry size
Yeah, them chicken coops was full'a bears
And choppers filled the skies

Well, we shot the line and we went for broke
With a thousand screamin' trucks
An' eleven long-haired Friends a' Jesus
In a chartreuse micra-bus

Ah, Rubber Duck to Sodbuster, come over. Yeah, 10-4, Sodbuster? Lissen, you wanna put that micra-bus right behind that suicide jockey? Yeah, he's haulin' dynamite, and he needs all the help he can get.

Well, we laid a strip for the Jersey shore
And prepared to cross the line
I could see the bridge was lined with bears
But I didn't have a dog-goned dime

I says, "Pig Pen, this here's the Rubber Duck.
We just ain't a-gonna pay no toll."
So we crashed the gate doing ninety-eight
I says "Let them truckers roll, 10-4."

Break up our happy home

The way we love and the way we cry
Of all these things there lies a tie
Makes me feel that it's worth a try

Just because you've become a young woman now
There's still some things that you don't understand now
Before you ask some guy for his hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now
My mama told me
You better shop around

There's some things that I want you to know now
Just as sure as the wind's gonna blow now
The men'll come and the men are gonna go now
Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now
My mama told me
You better shop around


Try to get yourself a bargain, girl
Don't be sold on the very first one
Good-looking guys come a dime a dozen
Try to find you one who's gonna give you true loving

Before you take a man and say I do now
Make sure he's in love with you now
Make sure that his love is true now
I hate to see you feeling sad and blue now

Are we really happy here
With this lonely game we play
Looking for words to say
Searching but not finding
Understanding any way
We're lost in a mask, masquerade

Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Thoughts of weeping disappear
Every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try, oooh
To understand the reasons
That we carry on this way
We're lost in a mask, masquerade

You made a fool of me
But them broken dreams have got to end

Hey, woman, you got the blues
'Cause you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere,
So just make some miles between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame.

Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman,
Evil woman.

Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold, too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
And you found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do?
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feelin' pain
But you better get your face on board the very next train.

Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman,
(You're an evil woman) evil woman.

Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman,
(You're an evil woman) evil woman.

Evil woman, how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha, ha, funny how you broke me up,
You made the wine, now you drink a cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha, ha, very nice to know
That you ain't got no place left to go.

Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman,
(You're an evil woman) evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman,

It's not my way to love you just when no one's looking
It's not my way to take your hand if I'm not sure
It's not my way to let you see
What's going on inside of me
When it's a love you won't be needing, you're not free

Please stop pulling at my sleeve if you're just playing
If you won't take the things you make me want to give
I never cared too much for games
And this one's driving me insane
You're not half as free to wander as you claim

But I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Give the word, I'll play your game
As though that's how it ought to be
Because I'm easy

Don't lead me on if there's nowhere for you to take me
If loving you would have to be a sometime thing
I can't put bars on my insides
My love is something I can't hide
It still hurts when I recall the times I tried

But I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy

Don't do me favours, let me watch you from the distance
'Cause when you're near, I find it hard to keep my head
And when your eyes throw light at mine
It's enough to change my mind
Make me leave my cautious words and ways behind

That's why I'm easy, yeah I'm easy
Say you want me, I'll come running
Without taking time to think
Because I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Give the word, I'll play your game
As though that's how it ought to be

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change  the beauty of the melody
Until it sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me

So she could hear my man a-wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they was blowing like a hurricane

Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup

Still the one that turns my head
We're still having fun and you're still the one

I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it till I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow

You're still the one that makes me laugh
Still the one that's my better half
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You're still the one that makes me strong
Still the one I want to take along
We're still having fun and you're still the one, yes you are

Changing, our love, it comes and goes
Even though we grow, it grows too

You're still the one that I love to touch
Still the one and I can't get enough
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You're still the one who can scratch my itch
(You're) Still the one that I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You are still the one that makes me shout
Still the one that I dream about
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You are still the one
Yeah, still the one
We're still having fun and you're still the one

Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

It's not that I don't love you
You know how much I do, huh
And it's not that I've found someone
To take the place of you
It's just to feel the feel with in me
Every time you touch my hand
And a dread that shakes my body
That even I don't understand

So I'm leaving (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)
Before love
Breaks my heart

(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

Ooh you're clinging to me tighter
Than you ever have before, I don't understand it
And I know it's gonna take everything I've got
To keep walking out the door
But those arms you've got around me
Will let me go some day
And I'd rather leave you holding on
Than pushing me away

So I'm leaving, yes I am (I'm leaving, yes I am)
This time I'm playing it smart (I'm leaving, yes I am)
I'm gonna walk away from love (Walk away from love)

Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Don't hesitate

Ooh baby I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, everyday
Wanna be with you night and day

Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some firefly
Wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine
Don't hesitate

Ooh baby I love your way, everyday
Wanna tell you I love your way, oh
Wanna be with you night and day, oh yeah

Well don't hesitate

Brown and gray, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one
Out of season

What's the sense in sharing this one and only life,
Endin' up just another lost and lonely wife?
You'll count up the years, and they will be filled with tears...

Love only breaks up to start over again;
You'll get the babies, but you won't have your man,
While he's busy loving every woman that he can... uh-huh...

Say I'm gonna leave a hundred times a day;
It's easier said than done, when you just can't break away! (When you just can't break away!)

Ooh, young hearts run free;
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...
My man and me...

Ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true;
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you...
Don't love you...

It's high time now, just one crack at life;
Who wants to live in, in trouble and strife?
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me... mmm...

I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days,
Encourage the babies every time they say,
"Self-preservation is what's really going on today..."

Say I'm gonna turn loose a thousand times a day,
But how can I turn loose when I just can't break away! (When I just can't break away!)

Oh, young hearts run free;
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...
You and me...

Ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true;
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you...
Don't love you...

Oh, young hearts run free;
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, young hearts, to yourself be true;
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you...
It don't love you...

Ooh, young hearts run free;
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...

Oh, young hearts, to yourself be true;

You know I love that organic cooking
I always ask for more
And they call me Mr. Natural
On down to the health food store

I only eat good sea salt
White sugar dont touch my lips
And my friends is always
Begging me to take them
On macrobiotic trips
Yes, they are

Oh, but at night I take out my strongbox
That I keep under lock and key
And I take it off to my closet
Where nobody else can see

I open that door so slowly
Take a peek up north and south
Then I pull out a Hostess Twinkie
And I pop it in my mouth

Yeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me

Well, at lunchtime
You can always find me
At the Whole Earth Vitamin Bar
Just sucking on my plain white yogurt
From my hand thrown pottery jar

And sippin' a little hand pressed cider
With a carrot stick for dessert
And wiping my face in a natural way
On the sleeve of my peasant shirt
Oh, yeah

Ah, but when that clock strikes midnight
And I'm all by myself
I work that combination
On my secret hideaway shelf

And I pull out some Fritos corn chips
Dr. Pepper and an Ole Moon Pie
Then I sit back in glorious expectation
Of a genuine junk food high

Oh yeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me

My friends down at the commune
They think I'm pretty neat
Oh, I don't know nothing about arts and crafts
But I give 'em all something to eat

I'm a friend to old Euell Gibbons
And I only eat homegrown spice
I got a John Keats autographed Grecian urn
Filled up with my brown rice
Yes, I do

Oh, but folks lately I have been spotted
With a Big Mac on my breath
Stumbling into a Colonel Sanders
With a face as white as death

I'm afraid someday theyll find me
Just stretched out on my bed
With a handful of Pringles Potato Chips
And a Ding Dong by my head

In the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me

Doctor, my woman is comin' back home late today
Could you maybe give me something
'Cause the feeling is gone and I must get it back right away
Before she sees

That I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again
All around, tryin' to get the feeling again
The one that made me shiver
Made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in

And I've looked high, low, everywhere I possibly can
But there's no, tryin' to get the feeling again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came

Where did it run to, I thought I'd done all that I could
Just to keep the lovelight burnin'
But whatever I've done, I guess I just haven't done it too good
'Cause all that's left is yearnin'

I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again
All around, tryin' to get the feeling again
The one that made me shiver
Made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in

And I've looked high and low and everywhere I possibly can
But there's no tryin' to get the feeling again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came

And I've been looking, I've been looking, I've been looking
I've been up, I've been down, and tryin' to get the feeling
I've been up, I've been down, I've been tryin' to get
I've been tryin', I've been tryin', I've been tryin' to get the feeling
I've been tryin' to get the feeling again

I want to get that feeling
I want to get that feeling
I got to get that feeling
I got to get that feeling again
And again and again and again
Tryin' to get the feeling
I've been tryin' to get the feeling again

Every night, she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
I mean, she was steaming

And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place

Friday night, they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's Bar and Grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys want to fight, you better let them

That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favourite song
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

Living in the city
Ain't never been my idea
Of getting it on
But the job demands
That you make new plans
Before your big chance is gone

You get a house in the hills
You're paying everyones bills
And they tell you that
You're gonna go far
But in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is that who you really are

Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
But your mind's on Tennessee
Looking back, I can
Remember the time
When I sang my songs for free

Country boy
You got your feet in L.A.
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then
My heart keeps going home

Talking on the telephone
Setting up another day
Of people to meet
You've gotta do what's right
You've gotta spend the night
Staying in touch with the street

When you're surrounded by friends
They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out
Cause in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is this what its all about

You got your feet in L.A.
