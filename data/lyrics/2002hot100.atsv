See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why
You're treating me so bad(treating me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me
And I was all you had

And though my heart is beatin' for ya
I can't stop crying
I don't know how
I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why
Ya wanna do me wrong (do me wrong)
See when I'm home, I'm all alone
And you are always gone(always gone)

And boy, you know I really love you
I can't deny
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears
After all these years

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Ohh
I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad
What love will make you do

All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
To all of my ladies(ladies)
Feel me, c'mon sing with me

See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you

So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to 'preciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me?
Leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up

Looking out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
This something always hold me back

Hot in
So hot in herre
So hot in, ah
Oh!

Wanna a little bit-a
And a little bit-a
Check a little bit-a
Just a little bit-a
Just a little bit-a
Just a little bit-a

I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious
Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience
I'm lookin' for the right time to shoot my steam
Lookin' for the right time to flash them keys

Then, um, I'm leavin' please believe in
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check in, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons
Penthouse, rooftop, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve and no teasin'

I need you to get up, up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for
'Cause I feel like bustin' loose and I feel like touchin' you
And can't nobody stop the juice, so baby, tell me, what's the use?
I said

It's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Oh, it's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles?
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' sportscars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, I do a hundred, top down and goggles

Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause baby I can't talk it

Warm, sweatin', it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank-top on at this point
You're with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun

So take it off like you're home alone
You know, dancin' in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, girl, I think my ass gettin' big

It's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

Mix a little bit-a...
With a little bit-a...
Let it just fall out
Give a little bit-a...
With a little bit-a...
(Let it hang all out)

With a little bit-a...
And a sprinkle of that...
Let it just fall out
I like it when ya...
Girl, baby make it...

Stop pacin', time wastin'
I got a friend with a pole in the basement (What?)
I'm just kiddin' like Jason (Oh)
Unless you gon' do it

Extra, extra, spread the news
Check it: Nelly took a trip from the lunar to Neptune
Came back with somethin' thicker than fittin' in sasoons
Say she like to think about cuttin' in restrooms

It's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

It's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Oh, It's gettin' hot in herre(so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
(Let it hang all out)

Mix a little bit-a...
With a little bit-a...

Give a little bit-a...

5@The Calling@Wherever you Will Go
@@@
So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there, oh
Who can bring me back to you

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now just quite how
My life and love my still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go

I'll go wherever you will go

Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me
Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh, oh

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight

(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know(all I know)

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal(it's so unreal)

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to
Watch you go(watch you go)

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard(I tried so hard)

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised
It got so(got so far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end(in the end)

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

Oh, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song, then baby

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars(you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy(I do it just cause I'm-)

Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song

Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm you girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad, hey

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
(Look at yourself)
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else

Everything's so blurry
And everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty
And everything is so messed up
Preoccupied without you
I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you
I stumble, then I crawl

You could be my someone
You could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you
From all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doin'
Imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us
But that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face

Everyone is changing
There's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending
And let me know just how you feel
'Cause I am lost without you
I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you
I stumble, then I crawl

You could be my someone
You could be my scene
You know that I will save you
From all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing
I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us
But that's not very far

Can you take it all away
Can you take it all away
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away
Can you take it all away
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Oh
Nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to run away
Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to run away

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

No!

And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in Gucci shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids

Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fuckin' you all wild
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a "Dear Ja" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather

Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy

I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-Wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered

Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Oh I'm feelin' like ya livin' a double life
'Cause you don't be comin' home sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time
Checkin' for one time

You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me, baby
I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone

Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious

And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Always there when you call, I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby be mine
Always there when you call,  I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby, be mine

Here at W-I and Z we play nuthin' but da hits
Nuthin' but da hits
Nuthin' but da motha fuckin hits...

Estoy

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

Just try your best
Try everything you can

You know you're doing better on your own (On your own)
So don't buy in
Live right now

[P. Diddy]
Yeah, Yeah
I need a, I want a

[Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life

[P. Diddy]
Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusin me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin me
Here's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusin me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word, it's just you and me

[P. Diddy & Usher]
Now let's ride.....

[Chorus: Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else cuz she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

[Loon]
Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
Cuz now I'm gettin money and the game gettin deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right
Anytime we together would feel so right
You the girl I been lookin for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
It's cuz of you girl, now I understand life

[Loon & Usher]
I need a girl...

[Chorus: Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else cuz she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

[P. Diddy]
I had a girl that would've died for me
Didnt 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Quarter K's, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But everytime I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's smile
This shit is wild
All dem days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss dem pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

[Chorus: Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else cuz she's all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else cuz she's all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else cuz she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

[Intro] (2x)
Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell

[Verse 1]
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

[Chorus] (2x)
You don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Verse 2]
Aw, girl
Your face is saying why
Tears in  eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me
Listenin' to friends
Now it's the endin'
Then again, no story can end without it
Damn I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

[Chorus] (2x)

[Bridge]
Gonna boogie tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home
Waiting for love
So tonight
I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party

(Oh yeahhh
I'm numb)

Within my heart are memories, of perfect love,

Above all the others, we'll fly

Oh, how quickly life can turn around, in an instant
It feels so good to reunite - Within yourself,
And within your mind - Let's find peace there

See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating(hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you Debbie."

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen toElvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till Osama comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

"Testing, attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them littleLimp Bizkitbastards

AndMoby, you can get stomped byObie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever sincePrinceturned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me

I am so high, I can hear Heaven
I am so high, I can hear Heaven
Oh, but Heaven, no, Heaven don't hear me

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away

Someone told me love would all save us
But how can that be? Look what love gave us
A world full of killing and blood spilling
That world never came

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away, ah-hah

Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away

And they're watchin' us(Watching us)
They're watchin' us(Watching us)

I don't want to see you waiting
I've already gone too far away
I still can't keep the day from ending
No more messed up reasons for me to stay

Well this is
Not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my time
You can't
Stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all again
Whoa-oh again

Months went by with us pretending
When did our light turn from green to red?
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again

Well this is
Not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my time
You can't
Stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my time again
Whoa-oh again

I see you waiting
Look so lonely
I see you waiting
I see you waiting

Well this is
Not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my time
You can't
Stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all
I'm wasting my time
I've wasted my - well this is

Please come now, I think I'm fallin'
I'm holdin' on to what I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm tryin' to escape

I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

I'm lookin' down now that it's over
Reflectin' on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace

I cried out, "Heaven save me"
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

I'm so far down

Sad eyes, follow me
But I still believe there's, somethin' left for me
So please come, stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's, somethin' left for you and me

For you and me
For you and me

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinkin'

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

Please come now, I think I'm fallin'

Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

Le do lo le lo le
Le do lo le lo le
Can't you see
I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
There over, here under
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes are for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

Le do lo le lo le
Le do lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
There over, here under
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear

Le do lo le lo le
Le do lo le lo le
Think out loud
Say it again
Le do lo le lo le lo le
Tell me one more time
That you'll live
Lost in my eyes

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
There over, here under
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really think the way I feel

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
There over, here under

Oh yes

It's funny coz for a while
I Walked around with a smile
But... deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me "This ain't right"
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to stay

You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)

Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you

You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)

Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be OK (I need to be OK)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you)

So now it's time for me to make that move

You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

I'm the kind of girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin' it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin

Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass
So you can tell your friends how you made it back

No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey

Jump on the stage watch me going crazy

Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me

Don't have no master suite
But I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride
But baby, I'm the one who has the key

Strapped with the veritek baby tec B.T.

Four to six shots and them things ain't around yet
Persona all thugged out loud and clear
Sayin' fuck the straight Henny, just grab me a beer
You see I'm reppin' now, and my mami's I got a weapon now
Shoot at them clowns at they feet, they high steppin' now
Left that wack label cause I don't like pricks

At the white boy club whylin' buyin the bar

I like when chocha be nappy too
I treat life like a fast car, low on my speed
I try and chill, and sell more records than Creed
Been a hustler (What? what?) way before "Melvin Flynt"
A criminal, don't need no prints
These dudes gave me a brick and they ain't seen me since
Coulda woulda, had them dudes straight hoppin' the fence, it go

(Chorus)

La la la la la la la la la (Oh!) (8x)


Noreaga:

Well oops I dunn dunna again, I got another one
I keep it hid in my pocket I got another one
Fast and furious, dunn dunn dunn tudunn
Still be in, Miami and jet skiin'
In the ocean where the sharks be at, just O.D.'n
Adebesi, want a brick to pay double easy
I got them thangs that a move easy
And I told the lawyer, I sold blow to old Goya
I'm half Spanish, you see I cook coke to Goya
Half spanish, all day arroz con polla
Recognize, when I'm runnin' the game, before me
Chickens wasn't even messin' wit brain, because me
Now you started gettin' head on the westside highway
So recognize my nigga you did it my way
Ice rockin', brick choppin' and gun shoppin'
I did it all beat cases without Cochran

Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From the start it, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?

I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallow my pride
Let it ride and party
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my

Is spell my name to get your vicki's to your ankles.
I'm seriously mami, you're fuckin' with the Kid
Aka William H. Bonnie
You know I'm the type that be crushin and merkin'
Having ladies touchin' the hurkin, blushin' and smirkin',
Early in the morning rushin from workin'
Screamin "Oh my.. F-A B-O L-O U-S"
Each night I'm freakin, ma' you aint gonna talk me to death,
Cuz you got free nights and weekends
Ghetto Fabs all over the place...
Oops, there goes my kids all over your face...
Oh my!

Umm I was looking so good I couldn't reject myself

Umm I was feeling so good I had to touch myself

What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreaming, but till I awake
Can't we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this

Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

(Verse 1: Truth Hurts)
He breaks, me down, he builds, me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes, in late, but it's, ok
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

(Chorus: Truth Hurts)
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

(Verse 2: Truth Hurts)
Oh! Tonight he's waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm takin, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I got

(Chorus: Truth Hurts)
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

(Verse 3: Rakim)
Thinkin of a masterplan, you know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a grand
Now it's kelos to c notes and how fast your grands
We ball like we own the world, your only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you try to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail will get you boot out
Just me and you high off sex I'm twisted
You OG'd and you OD addicted

(Chorus: Truth Hurts)
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for

"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
"Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white"
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for

I think I took too much
I'm crying here
What have you done?
I thought it would be fun

I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's being a little bitch
I think I'll get out of here

Where I can run
Just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear
You're just like a pill
'Stead of making me better
You keep making me ill

Maybe I should get some help

The better part of me

I'm more than a plane
More than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd
But don't be naive
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed
But won't you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up, up and away, away from me
Well it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for Kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me
Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me

I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man looking for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all toThe Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
(A woman's worth)

(Hold up)

If you treat me fairly I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
(Baby, I know you're worth it)
If you never play me, promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
('Cause baby, I know you're worth it)

She walks the mile, makes you smile, all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
(When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her
(Please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
(First baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

No need to read between the lines spelled out for you
(Spelled out for you)
Just hear this song 'cause you can't go wrong when you value
(When you value value)

Say
(Woman's)
Woman's worth

Yea

Craig David
Seven days
Check it out...

On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to
Rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
Cuz I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker, she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I oh, oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there

Ooh yeah
I'm not a man to play around baby
Ooh yeah
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat, for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When you're feeling all alone
All you gotta do, is just call me call me

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you-oh...

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday

Under the lovers sky
Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall
Well just wait until
'Til the sun goes down

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It will steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
Don't you know, don't you know
That you, can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight..No
You can't fight it...
It's gonna get to your heart

There's no escaping love
Once the gentle breeze
Weaves a spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long
'Til you're in my arms

Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss

But  you know, But you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight...No
You can't fight it...
No matter what you do
The light is gonna get to you

(You're gonna know
That I know)
Don't try, you're never gonna win, oh

But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight

But soon you'll be finding
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run you can hide
But you can't escape my love

So if you go
You should know
It's hard to just forget the past
So fast
It was good
It was bad but it was real and that's
All you have
In the end our love mattered
(No, no, no)

If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
(I won't beg you to stay)
But soon you'll be finding
You can run you can hide

But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide,

Loving you like this, what is a girl supposed to do

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

You can do anything you set your mind to, man.

Oooh!
Yeah, darkchild
B-rock, let's go

Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come to see me
You say that you're too busy (What?)

What the hell, I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind?
I can find another guy
Someone who will treat me right

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it, any longer
You can, go if you want
I don't, need your pity

I will, be just fine
If you decide, that you want to leave
Close the, door behind you
I just, want to know what

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about

What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about)
What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about us?)

Thought you said you were different
Was that what I heard you say?
Said that you'd love only me
Thought that you'd be all I need (What?)

What happened to promises?
Said that you were a better man
Your words have no weight with me
'Cause you're counterfeit, I see

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it any longer
You can go if you want
I don't need your pity

I will be just fine
If you decide that you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about, what about

What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about)
What about us? (What about)
What about us, us? (What about us?)

Baby, check it out hear this
Now what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with
Now what if I told you the game we play, I picked it
Now what if I said it wasn't true, so do you
You and I know without me there's no you

So what about bills that were past due, paid for you
All you say to me is: "Baby, I owe you" (Aha)
Forget about the brand new life that I gave you
Don't what about us to me 'cause we are through

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the nights that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me

What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?

You're a song, written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong, 'cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes is where I'll find them

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you, I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone, when the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a hey, hey, hey, hey

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true, Oh babe it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence, lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners, I'm tied up to this feel...

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes, ah wha ho oh woah
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl...

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime, tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime, tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

We were always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we began to love it (began to love it)
Watchin' all of the heartache and pain of the world
And thinkin' nothin' of it (thinkin' nothin' of it)
And baby, I got a love for you
And I know that you got me, baby
But everytime the sun shines bright
It gets so cloudy

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

Cause nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell ya before
About chasin' those waterfalls
Chasin' waterfalls

Cause nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, what did we tell ya before

Sometimes the Rule don't mind the rain
It kinda feels like I'm drownin' in the Lord's pain
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile, and give me a reason to keep on believin'
That everything ain't misleadin'
And I kiss the clouds on them rainy days
And smile for you, when the skies are gray
Babe, cause I'm a tear drop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord, would you shower my pain
Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel, that can't soar, can't fly
And I mastered it, Lord knows why

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

I feel like an angel
With my broken wings
So I can soar again
Lord, let me in
Baby, through all the passion, the pain, and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin', yeah

Makin' clothes for all of those
That spread the love
And for those who can't take it
Stand up
Baby, we gonna make it
In the words of Marvin Gaye
War is not the answer

Nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell ya before

(Lil' Mo) Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy!!!
(Angie M) Oh yeah yeah
(Lil' Mo) Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!
(Angie M) Uh, woo! come on, uh
(Lil' Mo) If I can go, with you
(Angie M) Yo, yo, uh

(Verse 1: Angie Martinez)
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

(Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Verse 2: Sacario)
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

(Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Bridge: Lil' Mo)
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

(Martinez Angie)
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

(Sacario)
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

(Angie+S)
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

(Sacario)
Go 'head

(Martinez Angie)
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

(Sacario)
Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

(Martinez Angie)
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

(Sacario)
And the shop's there?

(Martinez Angie)
If they don't got em, they don't make em

((Sacario:) True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

(Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Outro: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly way, like there is no, no tomorrow
And if I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all

Okay, here we go

Andre:
Yeah I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along..
See this is the way that ya walk on a sunny day
when it's rainin inside and you're, all alone
All alone - yeah!

Chorus:
Cause the whole world, loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)

Andre:
Take a little trip, hater back up yo' mind
Look forward not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin cause he thought could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever
from the neck - see ain't nuttin changed, hit the stage
Set a date sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin hair with stylin gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit fuck, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for dem niggaz workin at the airport
who got laid off, I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole, whole, world, world

Cause the whole world, loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you're in the news

And the whole world, loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)

Killer Mike:
Player I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat runnin like Randy Moss
Ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin my stone, gatherin no moss
Mami I'm comin I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on fourth fourth
Make that track a fourth fouth
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
with my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast just won't stop

Cause the whole world, loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you sing the blues

Big Boi:
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismal
Need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches
like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing God's willing all things that are do able
The only liable limitation is to self
Dre set it on the right and I set it on the left, cause

Cause the whole world, loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole world, loves it when you sing the blues

There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're
You're somethin' else

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been tryin' real hard
And givin' me your best

And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

So many moons that we have seen
Stumblin' back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better, better, better

For real
'Cause underneath it all,
You are my real Prince Charming
Like the heat from the fire

You were always burnin'
Anytime you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'

There's another side to you
And it's a human I adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure

Oh no, you're good for me baby
Of that, I'm a sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be...

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

Every sexy little thing you do
5'5" brown eyes with your thick thighs
Every time I see your smile got me hypnotized

Mira (so can i get your number or something)
Mi amor mirame bien
Te encantara
Si quisieras lo tendras (i dunno what you said but i like it)
Dondequiera, soy notada

Piel morena, ojos negros

[Intro: Marc Dorsey]
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

[Verse 1]
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, "You make me sick"
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrased to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self destruct

[Hook: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been on that journey always
I'm gon' luv u better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' luv u better

[Verse 2]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together

[Verse 3]
It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange mhhmm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said to make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way,
To make it so that you were right here,
Right now

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

Now,I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone no,no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeeaah...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I Drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains you're...
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone

What will I do if I can't be with you?
Tell me where will I turn to baby who will I be?
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart?
Baby why don't you see?
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong

To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uh
To all my niggaz that be livin' it up, we say...
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, ah
C'mon

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Baby, this aint your typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, ima fuck, you tonight thing
Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, ima leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangsters an hoe's go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me
'cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky
Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?
And do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama, Dodge and White Rolls
Uh-oh, another episode

[Hook: (Case) & Ja Rule]
(What, do I do?)
To all ma niggaz that be livin' it up, we say...
(What, I do)
To all ma bitches that be givin' it up, uhh
(What, you do)
To all ma niggaz that be livin' it up, we say...
(What, do I do?)
To all ma bitches that be givin' it up, uhh
(My love for you)
C'mon

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Bitches, just wanna hold the name thats active
That's why they suck dick with mo' passion than average
And I ain't mad at'cha
Never leave you alone
Cause we fucks when I'm home, phone sex when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus I freaks off like O-Dog in "Love Jones"
Been in, many zones, baby one hoes, two hoes
From, prissy bitches to hoes that do porno
But you know, the Rule be livin it up
And got all these hoes, givin it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, diggin them out, foot on the clutch
Rule baby, not givin' it up

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
C'mon, we get high
C'mon, we get ride
C'mon, we get live
Live yo' life
(Ooooooooh baby)

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me
Your whole vibe, like you high on Extasy
'Cause ain't nuthin' but an "E" thang baby
I know that pussy wet like crazy
I wanna feel your passion, come when you ask me
Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'
But ain't nothin' happenin'
The bitch got a little too high
Picked up my ride and started crackin'
The radio blastin' "Between Me And You"
But you ain't on the low with that freak thing you do
I thought you knew (What I do)
Know I know (What you do)
'Cause it's been a good night, your head ain't right
Like Teddy P, let's "Turn Off The Light"
And grind it out, takin' no times out
'Til the sun come out
Bitch, when you find out

[Hook 2x]

[Ja Rule]
C'mon, we get high
C'mon, we get ride
C'mon, we get live
C'mon, it's my time

Breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin a cruise.
Tell me who's your weed man, how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag, what you got in that bag?

And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin
The better I'm feelin, the more that I'm chillin
Willin, drillin and killin the feelin.
Now who's that bucked' naked cook fixin three-course meals?
Gettin goosebumps when her body tap the six inch heels

Are you custom-made, custom-paid, or you just custom-fitted?

You take a pick, while I'm rubbin the hips,
touchin lips to the top of the dick, and then woo!
Now tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?

Broken heart again

Gotta count on me

That I'll be fine

Why'd I play the fool
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
But maybe I liked the stress
Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

Messin' with my mind

I really don't wanna fight

(No more in my life)
I don't ever wanna hurt again
Wanna speak my mind
Wanna speak my mind

Oh it feels so good
When you let go
Of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain (free from all the pain)
Free from all the games (free from all the games)
Free from all the stress (free from all the stress)
To find your happiness

I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or lose
And I choose to win

Tired of you playin' games with my mind

No more crying every night

82@Kenny Chesney@The Good Stuff
@@@
Well me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon lights
The corner bar
It just seemed right, so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
down at the end lookin' half asleep
He walked up and said "What'll it be?"
I said,"The good stuff"
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said, "You can't find that here."

CHORUS 1
Cause its the first long kiss on a second date
your momma's all worried when you get home late
Droppin the ring in the spaghetti plate
cause your hands are shakin so much
It's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
and askin for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk
and he poured a glass
then I smiled and said,
"I'll have some of that."
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, "That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed."
He said, "Spent 5 years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me,
But Ive been sober 3 years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Chorus 2
Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl,
married his high school love
and it's a new t-shirt saying "I'm a grandpa"
and being right there as our time got small,
And holdin her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man, That's the good stuff

BRIDGE
He said,When you get home she'll start to cry,
When she says,Im sorry,saySo am I
Then look into those eyes so deep in love
and drink it up
'Cause thats the good stuff
That's the good stuff

Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions, switch positions, new position, new position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Stroke it for me
Stroke it baby, stroke it baby
Work it baby, work it baby
Stroke it

There is something I want you to do
I want you to use yourself
Like you never ever used it before
To explore my body
Until you reach the shore
I'll be calling, calling for more

I want you to
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle, work the middle

It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, til' the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

When Daddy let me drive

Daddy let me drive

Oh he let me drive

It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson
And electric choke

Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
Try to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here
To the twilight
There's a dead end to my left
There's a burning bush to my right
You aren't in sight
You aren't in sight

Do you want me
Like I want you
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

Mothers on the stoop
Boys in souped-up coupes
On this hot summer night
Between fight and flight
Is the blind man's sight
And a choice that's right
I roll the window down
Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down
Feel broken down

Do you need me
Like I need you?
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

Sweet sorrow is a call tomorrow
Sweet sorrow is a call tomorrow

Do you love me
Like I love you?
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by

CHORUS

Oh you're passing me by
Passing me by

Do you need me like I need you to?
Do you want me like I want you?
Or are you passing me by?
Or am I standing still?

Saying I can get you anything is ridiculous

Hold on, have faith in me
'Cause anything I have is yours, baby

Girl I know you wanna roll a Lexus
A Lexus with a mansion down in Texas
It's more like apartment 8 cellular is prepaid
But baby it's all okay
I can't do all the things I wanna do
But I can love you and I can stay true
I'll give you my last dime
Spend all my time
It's yours whatever is mine...
You can have anything you want

[Jaheim (Next)]
Now I don't have no LS to drive
(But I'm a man with a whole lot of plans and a lot of love inside)
Just believe and pray, hold on to me and say stay

Boy, I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door
You and your mans and them just Took over the floor
Started doin' your thang
And it made me notice you even more
The way you turned around and looked at me, it seemed as though
You must've somehow felt me starin' on the low
Somethin' tells meYou're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon
Feel like one of those nights

Why is this the first time that I'm seein' you around
Could you be visiting or are you new in town
Yeah, whatever the case
I'm feeling you right here and right now

Your smile and all the love you showin' lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of something special
Happy that I met you

I ain't even gonna front (Baby)

Seems like we've known each other most of our lives
After one conversation, this must be right

Don't know if I should lick my wounds
Or say woe is me instead
There's an achin' inside my head
It's tellin' me I'm better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see
If you will get some

They say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light

Cuz I think I am good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go

Had a nice little life
A little boat, a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew.

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well.

'Til you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish, caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet.

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well.

My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you.

There's a difference in
Living and living well
You can't have it all
All by yourself
Something's always missing
'Til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in livin'.
I thought I was living.
There's a difference in living and living well.

Livin' well.

Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my list of things to do today:
Go to the bank and the hardware store,
Put a new lock on the cellar door.
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done,
But when the sun is settled, there's still more than a few things left
I haven't got to yet.

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that i make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Wouldn't change the course of fate,
Cuttin' the grass just had to wait
Cause i've got more important things
Like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow, what I could get done today

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that i make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Raise a little hell, laugh till it hurts,
Put an extra five in the plate at church,
Call up my folks just to chat,
It's time that i make time for that
Stay up late, and over sleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things i've always missed
Just start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my List of things to do today.

If it weren't for your maturity none of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention you wouldn't have been successful and
If it weren't for me you would never have amounted to very much

Oooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Oooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no-one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're kind of my protege and one day you'll say you learned all you know from me
I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would and I think I like it

And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

Just make sure you don't tell on me especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world 'cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might want to marry you one day if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

Oooh, this could be messy
But you don't seem to mind
Oooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said, "See ya later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rocking on MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy
She said, "See ya later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Well tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

I said, "See ya later, boy
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at a studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know"

Sittin' out on her daddy's farm

Said she could hear me singing in the choir

Trying to be the big deal
Playing down on Broadway
Getting there the hard way

Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I'm gonna be a star

Singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
Listen to the radio to hear what's cooking
But the music ain't got no soul

Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think the rest is

A long time gone
No I ain't hit the roof since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back

I said a long time gone
No I ain't honked a horn since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Whoa, it's been a long time

@@@
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
you the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
you the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young

Just somethin' about you
The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me
Gettin' scared now, right
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right, listen

I kinda noticed something one night,
In the club a frump face,
It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so is datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Yeah
You know I could make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, hold my jacket
And then...

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just want to love you baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby)
Girl....

(Pusha T)
Ma' whatcha wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow'
Point to me I say 'Yea, it's the same dough'
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night

(Malice)
Do a robbery, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
(I just love your...brain...)
Play number three, Joint called 'Brain'
Ma, take a hint
Make a swerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl..
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl...)

Ain't nobody love you like I love ya
(Can't love ya like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Makes me trust ya like I do, hey)
Late at night I talk to you (hey)
You will know the difference when I...

(Break it down)

You know
I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way
Drums... (hey)

It's kinda special right, yeah
You know, if you think about it
Sometimes people are just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is

Now everybody dance

He was a 6 foot stallion say the storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpatatin' everytime he came near
He had a spankin new Range sport a tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his hair was corn-rowed
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Cuz I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Me and my crew started groovin made our way to the floor
It's time activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me I felt fingertips
On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this thug my man that I can tell you, for sure

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Cuz I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Now watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin all the pappi's want me but all I want is you

(I do)
