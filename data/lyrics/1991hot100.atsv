Look into my eyes, you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more

Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
You can't tell me it's not worth dying for
You know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you

Look into your heart, you will find
There's nothing there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do, I do it for you, oh yeah

There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah

Look into your heart, babe
Oh yeah

Ohh, you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more

Yeah, I would fight for you
I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you
Yeah, I'd die for you

You know it's true
Everything I do, oh
I do it for you

Everything I do, darling
Yeah, we'll see it through
Oh, we'll see it through, oh yeah

Trying to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so you, what's up
Hands in the air, come on, say yeah

Party people in the house

Let the music take control of your heart and soul
Unfold your body is free and behold

Dance 'till you can't dance

Get on the floor and get a blow

Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then

Can't you tell from the look on my face
That I love you more today

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love?
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

Although some time has passed
I still remember just like it was yesterday
The time is moving fast

The love I have for you, time won't ever change
I always feel the same
Now until the end

Memories we share will live forever
Deep inside my heart I know I'll never forget

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love?
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away

And it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace

From a distance, we don't have enough,
And no one is in need.
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease,
No hungry mouse to feed.

From a distance, we are instruments
Marching in a common band.
Playing songs of hope,
Playing songs of peace.
They're the songs of every man.

God is watching us.

From a distance.

From a distance, you look like my friend,
Even though we are at war.
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for.

From a distance, there is harmony,
And it echoes through the land.
And it's the hope of hopes,
It's the love of loves,
It's the heart of every man.
It's the hope of hopes,

Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove 'em wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy, it's you I can't do without

I feel better when I have you near me
'Cause no other love around
Has quite the same ooh, ooh(ha ha)
Like you do, do-do-do, babe

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove 'em wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

Oh, do without you
Love would never do without you
Whoo
Do without you

Never do without you...
Ooh...
Ooh!
Ooh!
C'mon!

(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Again!
(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Do it for me, now!
(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Again!
(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Sing it again, now!

(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Again!
(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Make it funky now
(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Wooh
(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Again!

(Love will never do, love will never do without you)
(Love will never do, love will never do without you)
(Love will never do, love will never do without you)
What?

(They said it, they said it wouldn't last)
(They said it, they said it wouldn't last)
(They said it, they said it wouldn't last) What do you want?
(They said it, they said it wouldn't last) If you believe in love, sing!

(Love will never do, love will never do without you)
(Love will never do, love will never do without you)

They said it wouldn't last (last...), we had to prove them wrong, (wrong...)
'Cause I've learned in the past that love will never do without you... (Love will, love will, just won't do without...)
We had to prove them wrong,
'Cause I've learned in the past that love will never do without you... (Just won't do without you...)
We had to prove them wrong,
'Cause I've learned in the past that love will never do without you... (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)

I wanna kiss you in Paris
I wanna hold your hand in Rome
I wanna run naked in a rainstorm

Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what, so now what?

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

I want to know you
Not like that
I don't wanna be your mother
I don't wanna be your sister either

I just wanna be your lover
I wanna be your baby
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Talk to me - tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears

Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!

Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I wanna be your baby

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love
To justify my love
Wanting, to justify

Waiting, to justify my love
Praying, to justify
To justify my love
I'm open, to justify my love

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night

And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars

Don't need a book of wisdom

She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon

She's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling a private tune
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you.

She's a flower, I could paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run

Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, whoa no
'Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah
And we're all magic friends(magic friends, magic friends)

Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become

We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When we only bring each other pain

I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, hey

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone

Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
Ooh, I don't wanna cry, no oh yeah

All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing

'Cause I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)Ooh

Though life is never easy the rest in unknown
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone
Spent each and every moment
Searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now and it's shining on me
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me, you're sharing with me

Starting again is part of the plan
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step I'll make it through, I know I can
It may not make it easier
But I have felt you near all the way

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now and it's shining on me

Forever I'll stand on the rock
Ever, ever, can't nobody stop me

There's my man hangin' out at the back.
So I cruise, slide through the dance floor.
I never seen a club so "hype" before.
Get on the mic and get raw,
Back to back, front to front,
Door to door.
Ev'rybody dance to the new sound:
Rock 'n' roll, soul to soul.
Now, bring it on down from the bottom to the top
and the top to the bottom. Hmmm.
I got 'em.
People ev'rywhere, they jump,
They think, they hear,
They shake, they jam their ear,oh yeah.
So, loosen your body and let me take control.

Let's rock and roll.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go.
We're gonna rock and roll.
We're gonna move your soul.
We're gonna make you groove.
Ev'rybody move.
Ev'rybody move, yeah.
Ev'rybody move, yeah
Ah' Freak out!

Whether you're into club or dance or rap or acid,
Come on, get with it.
That's it.
Throw your hands in the air.
Scream, "go, go, go."
Rock 'n' roll will grow and flow and yo,
It will develop into a new form,
Break the norm, get warm
And then swarm come back again,
Tear it up and transform from
B.B. king to Bo Diddley.
Ed Sullivan was on the T.V. screen
to be seen with the Beatles
and The Jackson Five.
The Who, The Doors, The Rolling Stones
and even I've dibbled a bit to get wit'.
Helpin' to prove that it's legit, yet
Parents dissed it back to the days
The same way the dissed rap.
Are you amazed? So D.J.'s

Let's rock and roll
Play that rock and roll:
Rock plus funk and soul
get on up and dance, Yeah.
We're gonna rock and roll.
We're gonna move your soul.
We're gonna make you groove.

Get on up and dance, yeah.
Play that beat, play that beat. Bang!
Play that beat, play that beat. Bang 'em!

Go go go go go go go go.
Go go go go go go go.
Ah! Freak out!

On the dance floor is where we all get raw
Like a kid in a candy store.
So, get up, get out your seat and arise.
Ev'rybody, ev'rybody up and get "live".
The C+C Music Factory is mastery
And full fo jams that have to be pumped
'til your ears get sore.
Live from Brooklyn out to the California seashore,
We came to rock and roll,
To get on down to somethin' funky with soul.
Rob and Dave seduced it and I juiced it,
Spruced it, mass produced it, and you proofed it.
Party people, if your havin' a good time
And singin' along to my rhyme,
This goes out to the young and to the old,

Let's rock and roll.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go rock and roll.
We're gonna move your soul.
We're gonna make you groove.

I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

With love that we can share

With you I never wonder, will you be there for me?
With you I never wonder, you're the right one for me

A love to last my whole life through
I finally found the love of a lifetime
Forever in my heart, I finally found the love of a lifetime

With every kiss our love is like brand-new
And every star up in the sky was made for me and you
Still we both know that the road is long
(But) We know that we will be together
Because our love is strong

To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes

Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower

Tell me why
When I scream there's no reply
When I reach out there's nothing to find
When I sleep, I break down and cry (cry) yeah

Beaten by the storm (storm)
Talking to myself, getting washed by the rain

Where do we go from here?
What must we do to make that change?
It's time to understand, understand one another

In a world so cold a place of disbelief
Where will the people go without enough to eat
Let's not give up hope
We have to find a way
Search within our soul to make a better day

Chorus:
This house is our house
Let's do it for the people
This house is their house
Let's give it back to the people
The people of the world today

I see hurt in their eyes
I hear the sounds of voices cry
It's time to open our eyes
Time to help one another

In a world so cold a place of disbelief
Where can the people go to find a place to sleep
Let's not give up hope we have to find a way
Search within our soul to make a better day

Chorus

Bridge:
You-Me-We can make the difference
And you know no one, no one likes to be alone
We got to face it heart to heart
We have to make a brand new start
We got to change the tears to smiles
We have to go the exta mile

(you-me) It's time we face reality

Give them hope and set them free
I think it's time we say goodbye
To all the homeless people's cry

Priorities confuse the mind

This inner peace I've yet to find

Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
That a circle can't fit where a square should be

There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can't be filled with the things I do

Hole hearted
Hole hearted

This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay kept warm inside
Day by day, less satisfied
Not fade away before I die

Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
Oh, that a circle can't fit where a square should be

There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you

Wanna be impulsive, reckless

Arrows through hearts, drawn on a misty window
You're taking me home in the rain

My head keeps saying, take it slow

I don't wanna think about it, don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze what I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive, reckless
And lose myself in your kiss

Acting on the moment, spontaneous
Whoa-whoa, oh, this is not like me
To follow my heart so easily

I am reckless (reckless), impulsive

Ain't no conjecture

Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing

Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally

The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time

And our sweet love will keep on growin'

Down in the gutter life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running under cover
Of a helicopter blade

Flames are getting higher
In effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still alive
Somewhere, some way
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up!
Light it up!
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, yeah

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle
Of a slot machine
Love may still exist
In another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Washes away the tears

Only after the rain
Can you live again

I know the emptiness
You feel inside
You're thinking if you break away
You'll never survive

Beats just for you
Come on and take my hand
And I'll pull you through

But things will never change
Until you want them to

True love again

Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy

I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off 'cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies say they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any kid n' play

Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music, white boy I can't hear you, say it
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
Play that funky music, white boy it, come on
Yea, a little bit louder
Now come on, come on

Stage 2 -- Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
It's off my head so let the beat play through
So I can funk it up and make it sound good
1-2-3 Yo -- Knock on some wood
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet

I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
Soon -- Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music white boy Let's do it

VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
'Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
You trapped me once and I thought that
You might have it
So step down and lend me your ear
'89 in my time! You, '90 is my year
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, I
Play that funky music white boy can't hear you

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
So don't be mad and don't be sad
'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song

Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
Play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
Play that funky music A little louder now
Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on

Baby, theirs something I think you should know
I don't think I'll be needing you anymore
It's just one of those things
I'm sure you'll understand

We've been together so long
I never meant to do you wrong
But I've found someone new
Theirs nothing you can say or do
To try and change my mind
Would be a waste of time
Lets go our seperate ways
Theirs nothing more to say
Just try to ease your mind
'Cause I don't mean to hurt you
It's just he's knows to treat me like a special lady
It's time you look away
He's knows just how to touch me
Maybe someday you'll understand

Chorus:
Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if its wrong or right
Temptation is a part of life
It doesn't matter if its wrong or right
It makes you do what you love

He's knows I can't resist
Ooh, his perfect lips
When he looks in my eyes
I feel like I've been hypnotized
I've wanted him for so long
What I felt was oh so strong
Times, feelings change
Things were not the same
Just try to ease your mind
'Cause I don't mean to hurt you
It's just he's knows to treat me like a special lady
It's time you look away
He's knows just how to touch me
Maybe someday you'll understand

Little lady you look so fine

(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
(On your loving)

Verse 1
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

Verse 2
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty , you're ready for lovin'
You're real independent so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay,
(Oooh you love me) come around my way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)

Verse 3
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby-hair pumping, lip gloss is shinin'
I think you in the mood for winin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee, I love you (smooch)
You're from around the way

CHORUS
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl
That's the one for me
She don't love him
(You got me shook)
I need an around-the-way girl, an around-the-way girl
Fine as can be
(Oooh you love me)
She oh, yea
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me (the only one for me)
I need an around-the-way girl (an around-the-way girl)
Fine as can be

Every night I say a prayer in the hopes that there's a Heaven
But every day I'm more confused as the saints turn in to sinners
All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside, so afraid that I've lost my faith

Show me the way
Show me the way
Take me tonight to the river and wash my illusions away
Please, show me the way

As I slowly drift to sleep for a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace in a world so filled with hatred
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news and find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign, so afraid I just won't know

Show me the way
Show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain and take my confusion away
And show me the way

And if I see your light, should I believe?
Tell me, how will I know?

Show me the way
Show me the way
Take me tonight to river and wash my illusions away
Show me the way
Show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage to believe I will get there someday
And please show me the way

Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete, yeah
Lord, I'm needing you now, tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly, woah

To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind

Watching the others, chances drift by
They'll never discover these feelings I hide
Deep inside I'm falling apart
All alone with a broken heart
Thinking in silence is all they allow
These words still unspoken may never be found
All these dreams one day will be mine
They cross my mind
My time has yet to come
Until then

The wind is moving
But I am standing still
A life of pages
Waiting to be filled

A heart that's hopeful
A head that's full of dreams
But this becoming
Is harder than it seems

Feels like I'm
Looking for a reason
Roamin' through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

If there are millions
Down on their knees
Among the many
Can you still hear me

Hear me asking
Where do I belong?
Is there a vision
That I can call my own?

Show me, I'm
Looking for a reason
Roamin' through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on

Well I see him on the TV
Preaching about the promised lands
he tells me believe in Jesus
steals the money from my hands
some say he was a good man
Lord I think he sinned.... yeah

Twenty two years of mental tears
cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war
on a foreign shore
to find his country didn't want him back
their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
our lawyers took his wife and kids no regrets
In a time I don't remember
in a war he can't forget
he cried "forgive me for what I done there
Cause I never meant the things I did"

Chorus
and give me something to believe in
if there's a lord above
and give me something to believe in
oh, lord arise

My best friend died a lonely man
in some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
and they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down n cry
as the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
like a lost soul out of place
and the Mirror mirror on the wall
sees my smile it fades again

Chorus
and give me something to believe in (I give me something to believe in)
if there's lord above
and give me something to believe in (I give me something to believe in)
Oh, lord arise

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
things I didn't know then,
Road you gotta take me home

Solo

I drive by the homeless
sleepin' on a cold dark street
like bodies in an old bone grave
underneath the broken old neon sign
used to read "Jesus saves"
A mile away live the rich folk
and I see how they're livin' it up
but while the poor they eat from hand to mouth
the rich are drinkin' from a golden cup
and it just makes me wonder
why so many lose and so few win... Ha!

Give me something to believe in
give me something to believe in
If there's a lord above
give me something to believe in
oh lord arise
give me something to believe in
you take the high road
give me something to believe in
and I'll take the low road
give me something to believe in
you take the high road
and give me something to believe in
and I'll take the low road

Yeah, sometimes I wish I didn't know now
things I didn't know then... yeah.

Can you tell me what it is we really want to find
Is the truth really there or is it right under our hair
For all we know it's been there all the time

I say, nothin' comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sittin' idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothin' comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're lookin' for still isn't found

VERSE 2:

Go for it and when you win, say "I go for it"

Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life

So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over
Or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind

Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you in silent lucidity

I can't do this
Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Help me

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down and a new world will begin
Living twice at once, you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly

A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive
You can be the guide but

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you

I like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no, no, just because

Ooh, you wait a long time for me

Say you're mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know

Sweet anticipation
Making spells

Fall across all our yesterdays

I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
Two priests on a ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying
To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach
Which way the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black
Like a murder of crows

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way, I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor
For they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor
Than be a fat man in the eye of a needle
As these words were spoken, I swear
I hear the old man laughing
"What good is a used up world
And how could it be worth having?"

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly  like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists
Then how come he never lived here?

The teachers told us
The Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple
And an edge of the empire Garrison town
They lived and they died, they prayed to their gods
But the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbled till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a northern sun
If I had my way, I'd take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations
They only get better one by one

One by one
One by one by one
One by one

I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play

I am the one and only
Oh yeah!

Call me, call me by my name
Or call me by number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it

And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am
Don't tell me "I know best"
I'm not the same as all the rest

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I've been a player in the crowd scene
A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces

High hopes and aspirations
Ideas above my station
Maybe but all this time I've tried
To walk with dignity and pride

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I can't wear this uniform
Without some compromises
Because you'll find out that we come
In different shapes and sizes

No-one can be myself like I can
For this job I'm the best man
And while this may be true
You are the one and only you

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only (The one and only)
You can't take that away from me

Arm me with harmony
Dave drop a load on 'em

verse 1:
Hmm...OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People...scratch yo temple
The last P Well...that's not that simple
It's sorta like a, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that I'm missin' here
You get it on occassion if the other party
isn't game'n it seems I gotta start the explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number then left feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, some other people's pu... You get it?
There's no room for relationships there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at?
Who thinks it's wrong 'cos I was splittin' and co-hittin' dat?
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

Chorus:
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (All the homies)
abs thta was fresh x7
yeah u know me,yeah u know me yeah u know me all da homies!

verse 2:
As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something
different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean-- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanness and meanness
I won't get into that, I'll do it...uh...sorta properly
I'll say the last P...hmm...stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me
exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with it, discount

Chorus:
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (Every last lady)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (All the ladies)

This gal tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that, matter-of-fact, hell, my girl was partners
that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, "Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave"
She said, "Oh no, I love you Treach" I said, "Now child please"
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said I'll look you to the stairs and to the stair window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cos you knew I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP visit with him or her
For sure, I'm going to admit it:  When OPP comes,
Damn skippy, I'm wit' it

Chorus:
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (This whole party)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) 3X
Who's down with OPP (This whole party)

Break it down!

I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live

So this is love
or so you tell me
as you're walkin
out the door
the months go by
and I know for certain
it's not the love
I'm looking for

but sometimes
just for a moment
I reach out
hope you're still there

Miles away
no you're never turning back
and I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
nothing left of what we had
just when I needed you most
you were miles away

it's hard to tell
what you're going through
you kept your feelings locked inside of you
open your heart and chances are
what you're feeling
I'm feeling too

if only just for a moment
hold on to the dreams that we had

Miles away
no you're never turning back
and I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
nothing left of what we had
just when I needed you most
you were miles away

when times were tough
and you were down and out
who was there by your side
but now you're gone
and I'm so tired of being alone
with only your promises

the loneliness just fades away
thoughts of you just memories
no cryin out for what you're missing
time won't forget
what you meant to me

if only just for a moment
hold on to the dreams that we had..

You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like

Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up

Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like

Who me?  A tease?  Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen tothe Miracles
Echo through the alley down below, oh yeah

Let's dance together just for the night
Let's don't worry about the future or nothing else
'Cause like the music's saying you gotta take chances
Go ahead, just do it and trust yourself

There's a soul in the city
Watching over us tonight
There's a soul in the city
Saying everything's gonna be alright

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo through the alley down below, oh yeah

They wish us luck but they think we're just dreaming
Let's prove them wrong, baby
'Cause you know what luck is luck is believing you're lucky
That's all and showing just a little bit of faith

There's a soul in the city
Watching over us I swear
There's a soul in the city
There's a whole world waiting out there, ah yeah

I got plans for us playing like a skip on a record
Through my head all night long
But when we walk that darkened stairway and step out on the roof
I know what we're  feeling can't be wrong, ah yeah

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo through the alley down below, oh yeah

Letthe Temptationssing it one time

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo through the alley down below, oh yeah
