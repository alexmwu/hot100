11@Third Eye Blind@How's It Going To Be@I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore, Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for, When I say out loud, I want to get out of this I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss?  I wonder How it's going to be, when you don't know me How's it going to be, when you're sure I'm not there? How's it going to be, when there is no one there to talk to Between you and me? 'Cause I don't care How's it going to be? How's it going to be?  Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match, Sharp as a thumbnail scratch, A silence I can't ignore, Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in, Swings empty, I don't see lightning like last fall when it was always about to hit me  I wonder How's it going to be, when it goes down? How's it going to be, when you're not around? How's it going to be, when you find out there was nothing Between you and me? 'Cause I don't care How's it going to be  How's it going to be, When you don't know me, any more? And how's it going to be  Want to get myself back in again, The soft dive of oblivion I want to taste the salt on your skin The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion  How's it going to be, When you don't know me, anymore? How's it going to be? How's it going to be? How's it going to be?

53@Xscape@The Arms Of The One Who Loves You@Verse One (LaTocha): I know you're going, I can't make you stay. I can only let you know I love you any way. And if the road you take leads to heartbreak, Somewhere down the line. If someone ever hurts you, Or treats your heart unkind...  Chorus: You just run to the arms of the one who loves you. You just run to these arms, And these two arms will keep you warm. When rain has found your heart, Never fear, I'm never far. You just run to the arms of the one who loves you.  Verse Two (LaTocha): I want you happy, I want the best for you.   And if you have to leave to find your dream, I hope that dream comes true. But if the world you find brings you hard times, If someone makes you cry, I'll be there to hold you, I'll be standing by.  Repeat Chorus  Bridge (Tamika): My love is strong enough, you know, Strong enough to let you go. But I'll always hold you, Inside my heart. And if you should ever change your mind, You can come back any time, And when you do...  Repeat Chorus

How do I get myself back to the place where you said  I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye  I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right, all right  And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing The velvet, it rips in the city We tripped on the urge to feel alive Now I'm struggling to survive Those days you were wearing that velvet dress You're the priestess, I must confess Those little red panties they pass the test Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress  One, and you hold me And we are broken Still it's all that I want to do Just a little now  Feel myself hovering off the ground I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile But nothing is all right, all right  And I want something else to get me through this life, baby I want something else, not listening when you say Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there In the place we used to start  I want something else

96@Boyz II Men@4 Seasons Of Loneliness@I long for the warmth of days gone by When you were mine But now those days are memories in time  Life's empty without you by my side My heart belongs to you No matter what I try  When I get the courage up to love somebody new It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change  In comes the winter breeze That chills the air and drifts the snow And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe  When springtime makes its way here Lilac blooms reminds me of The scent of your perfume  When summer burns with heat I always get the hots for you Go skinny dippin' in the ocean Where we used to do  When autumn sheds the leaves The trees are bare when you're not here It doesn't feel the same (It doesn't feel the same, oh)  Remember the nights When we closed our eyes(we closed our eyes) And vowed that you and I Would be in love for all time  Everytime I think about these things I shared with you I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change  In comes the winter breeze That chills the air and drifts the snow And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe  When springtime makes its way here Lilac blooms reminds me of The scent of your perfume  When summer burns with heat I always get the hots for you Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do  When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare When you're not here It doesn't feel the same  This loneliness has crushed my heart(it's killing me, baby) Please let me love again 'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again  In comes the winter breeze That chills the air and drifts the snow And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe  When springtime makes its way here Lilac blooms reminds me of The scent of your perfume  When summer burns with heat I always get the hots for you Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do  When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare When you're not here It doesn't feel the same (It doesn't feel the same)  Remember the warmth of days gone by
