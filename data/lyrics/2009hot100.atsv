5@Taylor Swift@Love Story@We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there On the balcony in summer air  See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns See you make your way through the crowd And say, "Hello." Little did I know  That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!" And I was crying on the staircase Begging you, "Please don't go!" And I said  Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."  So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew So close your eyes Escape this town for a little while Oh, oh  'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!" But you were everything to me I was begging you, "Please don't go!" And I said  Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."  Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel This love is difficult, but it's real Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."  Oh, oh  I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town And I said  Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you but you never come Is this in my head, I don't know what to think He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone I love you, and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."  Oh, oh Oh, oh, oh  'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

55@Coldplay@Viva la Vida@I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own  I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listen as the crowd would sing "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"  One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain Once you go there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become  Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field  For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world

60@Owl City@Fireflies@You would not believe your eyes If ten million fireflies Lit up the world as I fell asleep  'Cause they'd fill the open air And leave teardrops everywhere You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems  'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs From ten thousand lightning bugs As they try to teach me how to dance  A foxtrot above my head A sock hop beneath my bed A disco ball is just hanging by a thread  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)  Leave my door open just a crack (Please take me away from here) 'Cause I feel like such an insomniac (Please take me away from here) Why do I tire of counting sheep? (Please take me away from here) When I'm far too tired to fall asleep  To ten million fireflies I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)  But I'll know where several are If my dreams get real bizarre 'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (A jar)  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)  I'd like to make myself believe That planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

70@Nickelback@If Today Was Your Last Day@My best friend gave me the best advice He said each day's a gift and not a given right Leave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behind And try to take the path less traveled by That first step you take is the longest stride  If today was your last day And tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past Donate every dime you have? If today was your last day, If today was your last day.  Against the grain should be a way of life What's worth the price is always worth the fight Every second counts 'cause there's no second try, So live like you'll never live it twice Don't take the free ride in your own life  If today was your last day And tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past Donate every dime you have? Would you call old friends you never see? Reminisce old memories Would you forgive your enemies? Would you find that one you're dreamin' of Swear up and down to God above That you finally fall in love If today was your last day  If today was your last day... Would you make your mark By mending a broken heart? You know it's never too late To shoot for the stars, Regardless of who you are So do whatever it takes 'cause you can't rewind A moment in this life Let nothin' stand in your way 'cause the hands of time Are never on your side  If today was your last day And tomorrow was too late, Could you say goodbye to yesterday?  Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past Donate every dime you have? Would you call old friends you never see? Reminisce old memories Would you forgive your enemies? Would you find that one you're dreamin' of Swear up and down to God above That you finally fall in love If today was your last day

81@Zac Brown Band@Chicken Fried@You know I like my chicken fried Cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine And that's home you know Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine Where the peaches grow And my house it's not much to talk about But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground And a little bit of chicken fried  Cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up Well I've seen the sunrise See the love in my woman's eyes Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother's love  Well its funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know So if you agree have a drink with me Raise you glasses for a toast To a little bit of chicken fried  Cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up Well I've seen the sunrise See the love in my woman's eyes Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother's love  I thank god for my life And for the stars and stripes May freedom forever fly, let it ring. Salute the ones who died The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice All the things we love Like our chicken fried  Cold beer on a Friday night A pair of jeans that fit just right And the radio up Well I've seen the sunrise See the love in my woman's eyes Feel the touch of a precious child And know a mother's love

99@Maxwell@Pretty Wings@Time will bring the real end of our trial One day there'll be no remnants, no trace, No residual feelings within you One day you won't remember me.  Your face will be the reason I smile But I will not see what I cannot have forever I'll always love you. I hope you feel the same.  Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad You toyed with my affection Had to fill out my prescription for the remedy I had to set you free.  Away from me To see clearly The way that love can be When you are not with me I had to live I had to live I had to leave I had to leave  If I can't have you Let love set you free To flap your pretty wings around.  Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.  I came wrong you were right Transformed your love into "like" Baby believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies. I turned day into night Sleep till I die a thousand times I should've showed you Better nights, better times Better days, and I miss you more and more  If I can't have you Let love set you free To flap your pretty wings around.  Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.  Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.
100@The Fray@Never Say Never@Some things we don't talk about Rather do without, just hold a smile Falling in and out of love Ashamed and proud of Together all the while  You can never say never while we don't know it Time and time again Younger now then we were before Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go  Picture: you're the queen of everything As far as the eye can see, under your command I will be your guardian when all is crumbling I'll steady your hand  You can never say never while we don't know it Time,time and time again Younger now then we were before Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go  We're falling apart and coming together again and again We're coming apart but we pull it together Pull it together, together again  Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go Don't let me go
