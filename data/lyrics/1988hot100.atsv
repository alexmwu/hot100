Well, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues

Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes, I gotta have faith
Mm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I'll just have to wait
Because I got to have faith

I gotta have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor(I've just got to have faith)
Oh, oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

'Cause I gotta have faith
Mmm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

Oh oh yeah
Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah

With the sound of kids on the street outside

When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in the wave of love

Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

The flowers you gave me
Are just about to die
When I think about what could've been
Makes me want to cry

The sweet words you whispered
Didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

The memories of our loving
Still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere

Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still, what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all, at all

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
You can't hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
You can't hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

No, no-oh
How can you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

As I watch you move, across the moonlit room
There's so much tenderness in your loving
Tomorrow I must leave, the dawn knows no reprieve
God give me strength when I am leaving...

So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That we'll be back together someday

Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

As we move to embrace, tears run down your face
I whisper words of love, so softly
I can't believe this pain, it's driving me insane
Without your touch, life will be lonely

So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That we'll be back together someday

Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

Morning has come, another day
I must pack my bags and say goodbye...
Goodbye...

I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace

Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't just let me go

'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry

So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine

Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat

That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me, know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
Oh, the last one I had made me cry

So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine

Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride

Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine

Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head
Say you wanna be a midnight rambler

Quickly, but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers, get up
Beat that, uh

Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong

But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying

Live it up, live it up

Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
(Wild west)

Heading for the nineties, living in the eighties
Screaming in a back room, waiting for the big boom
Give me, give me wild west, give me, give me safe sex
Give me love, give me love, give me time to live it up

Now put your flags in the air and march them up and down
You can live it up, live it up all over the town
And turn to the left, turn to the right
I don't care as long as she comes tonight

She's so mean but I don't care
I love her eyes and her wild, wild hair
Dance to the beat that we like best
Heading for the nineties
Living in the wild, wild west
The wild, wild west
The wild, wild west(wild west)
Yeow, wild west

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turned up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their need

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I've been a victim of
A selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways, yeah
(Better change)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart
(You can't close your, your mind)
Then you close your mind

That man, that man, that man
That man, that man, that man
(With the man in the mirror, oh yeah)
That man you know, that man you know
That man you know, that man you know
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself then make that change

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, it's gonna feel real good

Just lift yourself
You know, you got to stop it yourself

I gotta make that change today, oh

You got to, you got to not let yourself, brother oh
Yeah, you know that (Make that change)

You got, you got to move

She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Her loving is so powerful, huh
It's simply unavoidable

The woman is invincible

She deserves the applause, I surrender the cause

Just when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for a while
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours

How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise?
Promises in vain
Love that is real but in disguise

What happens now?
Do we break another rule? Let our lovers play the fool
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

Well, I think I've been true to everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free
Everytime I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I'm wishing I could give you more

They died the day you let me go
Caught up in a web of lies
But it was just too late to know

Who would stand by my side

And now you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart

You said you'd die for me

Woke up to reality
And found the future not so bright
I dreamt the impossible
That maybe things could work out right
I thought it was you
Who would do me no wrong

And now you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away

At your side

Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me(understand me)
Maybe this time is forever
Say it can be, woah

That's all you wanted
Something special, someone sacred
In your life

Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side

Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me(understand me)
But something tells me together
We'd be happy, woah baby

Put your tiny hand in mine(I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher(be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind(it would make me)

I will be your father figure(very happy)
I have had enough of crime(please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time

That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime

That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue-eyed shine

This time I think that my lover
Understands me(understands me)
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be strong, baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine(my baby)
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time

If you are the desert, I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger, hunger for me
Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be

So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried

Beautiful darling
Don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes
Baby, baby
And love can't lie, no

(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
My love is always telling me so
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on, hold on
And won't let you go, my baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
And I have had enough of crime
So I am gonna love you
Till the end of time

Naughty girls need love too."

I've been told time and time again
That you can't treat love like a game
But I play rough with hearts that never mend
'Cause some guys like you do the same
Love was just a four letter word
Never heard how absurd it could be
But now I can't believe this is real
How I feel now you steal
My heart away from me

Used to be so good and so bad
Sex was something I just had
Used to always know what to do
Now you've got me confused

Baby don't let me be misunderstood
Temporary love's so bad but if feels so good
Then along came you
Now I know its true
Naughty girls need love too
Then came you, then came you

Yes, it's true
I'm in love with you
And believe it baby this time
Your love won't get away
Stay here in the place to be
We can get busy my way
For six forevers and a day-ay-ay
Ooh it's only you I adore
So much more than my body
Was asking for
Yes your love is breaking my chill
Even still there's a thrill
In my heart.

Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine

Seasons change with their scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me

I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me...

The way you make me feel

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha)
Be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Here, I'll give you my phone number
When you're worried, call me
I'll make you happy)

Ooo-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Now there, is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note-for-note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
A-listen to a-what I say
In your life, expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now

Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't do it, be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It will soon pass, whatever it is
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm not worried
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

(Bad medicine)

I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count 'em one, two, three

First you need(That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed(You get a little but it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees(That's what you get for falling in love)
And now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug, oh oh oh

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine

I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addition, that doesn't leave a track
I got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic, gonna save this heart attack

When you need(That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed(You get a little but it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees(That's what you get for falling in love)
And now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug, oh oh oh

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
That's what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Oh, that's what I need

I need a respirator 'cause I'm running out of breath
Oh, you're an all night generator wrapped is stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine, you'll take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better, baby, well they haven't found it yet, oh oh oh

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine

Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all

Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo

We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo

To Martinique, that Monserrat mystique

We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity

Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo

We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo

Port-au-Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse

Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
And get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama

I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough
Something tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carving up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me let's call it quits

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that

It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's getting out of hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

Oh if you wanna spread it around sister that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

All you have to do is say

We shouldn't waste a single day

So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling
A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

If they ever get you down
There's always something I can do
Because I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown
I'll always do what's best for you

There ain't no mistaking
It's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life

Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better

And my heart still aches for you

Well there was no risk that I wouldn't take
And not a promise that I didn't make
All I asked was that you just hold on
Now I'm a wondering what I did wrong

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Shoud've known better

I gave you all of my body and soul
Never believing we might lose control
I took my hands off the wheel

I can't remember if the lies were true
It's been a million years since I touched you
Well I thought time might help me win this game
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you

Tonight, it's been a year
We met each other here
Here I am all alone
As thoughts of you go on

Hear me crying out to you
You said, "never, never would I leave"
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart, I'll pretend
That you are here again

Hear me crying out to you
You said, "never, never would I leave"
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same

You're in my heart

I wanna know

There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know

Tell me what's on your mind

Pure energy

Here I am in silence
Looking 'round without a clue
I find myself alone again
All alone with you

I can see behind your eyes
The things that I don't know
If you hide away from me
How can our love grow?

I wanna know

There are some things you can't hide

Tell me what's on your mind

I know I could break you down
But what good would it do?
I could surely never know
That what you say is true

Here I am in silence
It's a game I have to play
You and I in silence
With nothing else to say

When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

Take me I'm yours into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight I really need to know

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
This message you're sending

Body to body, soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Love...love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No...I can't let you go...

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart

Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart

I always thought that
Ev'rything was fine
Without you
Never knowing you'd be mine

Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile

Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was,
What love was

I need you, I need you
And ev'ry day I love you
More and more
Without you
I know what it's all for

Suddenly I see you there
And ev'rything's okay
Don't know why I feel this way

Eyes so deep, you sent me melting

But then you seemed to change your mind
You looked away like you were oh so shy
Is the game you're playing hard to get
Won't you tell me, oh ho

Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night

I'd like to know more than just your name
Did you come here alone or with someone
If only you would open up
And let me know just where you're coming from

Are you looking for a new love
Or does commitment seem to bring you down
Is that a look of "Yes" or is it "No"
Please don't tease me, Ohhhhhh

Want me, don't you want me

Can't walk; can't talk

Oh I'm in love
Oh I'm in deep
'Cause baby

With a kiss you can strip me defenseless
With a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak - when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak
I get weak

Romantic eyes, persuasive lips
The helpless heart just can't resist their power
You know you've got a hold of me
You know you've got me where I want to be
'Cause lover
Like a wave you keep pulling me under
How I'll ever get out of this, I don't know
I just know that there's no way to fight it
Whoa...

We started out as friends

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Time I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When your gambling cards on love you play
I'd rather be in hell with you baby
Then in cool heaven, it seems to be the way

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Birds never look into the sun
Before the day is gone
But oh the light shines bright
On a peaceful day

Stranger blue leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you, makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love, and the earth rotates to our dictates
Slowly we make love...............

Sign your name across my heart......

Go out and find yourself a new play thing
Girl, you need a trip

No need to signify

You need to find someone that's true to you (TRUE TO YOU)

But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

Hey Baby, do as you please

After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promised fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying, "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far

Now I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My Baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

Diana walked up to me,
She said, "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "But unlock the door
Because I forgot the key"

Something happens to the pledges of trust
Down through the years they begin to rust

Still waiting for our happily ever after

Shattered in a thousand pieces

You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You fill me with hope
Love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

This is our time, we have it all
We have a way of knowing if we're heading for a fall
We'll work it out and get it right
And when I get home to you
You're such a sight for my poor eyes

This is our time, we have it all
When I come home at night
You're such a sight for my poor eyes

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You fill me with hope
Love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion

Well you know I can be found
Sitting all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please forget the past
The future's bright ahead
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Don't stop thinkin' of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over and love me
You know I want you to stay
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

Let's walk down to the preacher
Let's say "Hey, I do"

Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Maybe she cries herself to sleep every night

Sorry that the heartbeat that she knows so well
Ain't what she's looking for

You may think I'm fooling
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do

Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret about that
Well, come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts

Well, honey it ain't your money
'Cause I got plenty of that

I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do
There in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well, now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong

Well, they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That flesh does surely hold

They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man, I ain't going for that

I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you're doing
In the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Now, now, now, some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old
And that it just goes too fast

Oh, but love is bigger than a Honda (Honda)
And it's bigger than a Subaru (that too)
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do

Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac

Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there
In the back of your pink Cadillac
You know the one I mean, Le Car
Woah! Cadillac

You've got a fast car
I wanna ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I've got nothing to prove

You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us out of here
Been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
Live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young, to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

Say, remember when we were driving, driving in your car?
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
We go cruising entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
Now I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Say, remember when we were driving, driving in your car?
Speeds so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans and I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

Say, remember when we were driving, driving in your car?
Speeds so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged

Sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow
This time I'll go where she wants me to go
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
Deep in the woods down the low valley road

While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He took her all the way down the long valley road
They sent her away not too much later
And left him walking down the old valley road

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on alone, alone

Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
Everybody knew what they were talking about

Whoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
She came back around like nothing really happened
And left him standing on the old valley road

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, on the valley road

Standing like a stone on the old plantation
The rich old man would have never let him in
Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry
When it all happens, nobody wins

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on alone, alone

Girl...the only thing that matters in my life,
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no cause to treat me cold as ice

Ohhhh, girl
As long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
A no, oh a nooo
Don't be cruel
Girl you need to change your attitude
A no, oh
Don't be cruel

Hey yo cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was bein' real good to you
I treat you sweet take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post, but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

Ohhhh, girl
As long as I've been giving my heart  to you
You should be giving me your heart too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel

A no, oh a nooo
Don't be cruel
Girl you need to change your attitude
A no, oh
Don't be cruel

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you 12 yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front, and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl it's like a heart attack
I'm a real troop-trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side big dollars I'll clock

Ohhhh, girl
As long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool

Don't be cruel...
A no, oh

We used to hang out tough
Just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad, I can let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Roll to the fact that I want you Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', tryin' to make a killin'
Though about the dollars I make,
And you were willin'
To be with me, Bobby B.
But with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You wanna be with me,
You gotta be the same way that another girl would be
And if you wanna be with me

Don't be cruel

'Cause I would never be that cruel to you

I see me with you and all the things you do
Keep turning 'round and 'round in my mind
Forget the weather, we should always be together
And any other thought is unkind

To have you with me I would swim the seven seas
I need you as my guide and my light
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight

We'll be together, yeah
We'll be together, yeah
We'll be together, yeah

I see you with me and all I want to be
Is dancing here with you in my arms
Forget the weather, we should always be together
I'll always be a slave to your charms

To have you with me I would swim the seven seas
I need you as my guide in my life
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight

We'll be together, yeah
We'll be together, yeah
We'll be together, yeah

Call me baby
You can call me anything you want
Call me baby, call me, call me

I see you with me and baby makes three
I see me with you and all the things you do
Forget the weather, we should always be together
I need you as my guide and my light
My love is the flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight

We'll be together...

If you wanna keep something precious

Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town

You took my heart then you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
Ow! Uh

Daylight, spent the night without you
But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through
Hey, man, bet you can treat me right
You just don't know what you was missin' last night
I wanna see you begging, say forget it just for spite

Is so different now
I can't get by if we're not together
Ooh can't you see
Girl, I want you now and forever
Close to me

Hoping that you will promise to be mine

I could never live without you
Live without your love

For the way I feel
I know I've reached the right destination
And I know it's real

Hear the night music playing?
Don't you know what it's saying?
We should feel it together
Forever

Feel the beat and just hold on
To the sweet midnight flowing
Feel the music inside you
I'll be there too

Now's the time that our dreams are finally coming true
Feels so good we're crying
Now's the time when it's down to me and you
Spread these wings, we'll be flying

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Time to show all your feeling
All the night is revealing
Let the rhythm enfold you
Let me hold you

And we turn into music
Now we never will lose it
When the rhythm and night ride
No heart can hide

There are times that never ever come again
Memories there for making
When the night comes, we better let it in
All this love for the taking

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Won't you help me to let it through?
Don't you know what the night can do?

Each day I live
I want to be a day to give the best of me
I'm only one, but not alone
My finest day is yet unknown

I broke my heart, for every gain
To taste the sweet, I face the pain
I rise and fall, yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel, I will feel eternity

I've lived to be the very best
I want it all, no time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance, here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free

Oh, you're a winner, for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free
Oh, I will be, I will be free

Time flies
When you're having fun
I heard somebody say
But if all I've been is fun
Then baby let me go
Don't wanna be in your way
And I don't wanna be your second choice
Don't wanna be just your friend
You keep telling me that you're not in love
You wanna throw it all away

But I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me that's true
There's just some things I can't control

Your love is slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before
I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use
But I can't stay away from you

Hold on to every bit of hope, that's all I ever do
Hoping you might change your mind
And call me up to say how much you need me too
And though you're leaving me no other choice
Than to turn and walk away
Look over your shoulder, I'll be there
You can count on me to stay ...

'Cause I can't stay away from you
I don't wanna let you go
And though it's killing me that's true
There's just some things I can't control
Your love is slipping through my hands
And though I've heard it all before

I know you're telling me the truth
I know it's just no use

You are far, when I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough
To even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind
Till you listen to your heart

People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will, If you let them
Steal your heart from you
People,Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So good-bye, but please don't take my heart

You are far, I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart
People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will, If you let them, steal your heart

And people, will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you,
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

But remember this, every other kiss,
That you ever give, long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you, like I always do
There's something there, that can't compare
With any other

You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too.
I guess you were kissing a fool

You must have been kissing a fool

Well, I lived on the outskirts of town
In an eight room farmhouse, baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'

Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'

Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'

Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah

The winter days, they last forever
But the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks

One night, me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say,"Do you remember when?"

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'

Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'

Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
All right

Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah

17 has turned 35
I'm surprised that we're still livin'
If we've done any wrong
I hope that we're forgiven

Got a few kids of my own
And some days I still don't know what to do
I hope that they're not laughin' too loud
When they hear me talkin' like this to you

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young, and we were improvin'

Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant so much, baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'

Say yeah, yeah, yeah

You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart

And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
Am not the desperate type

If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no no no no no, I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together (Haaoo)
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe (Yeeaaah)
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
Oh, baby, yeah
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
(Oh baby, I do)
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves (Just give me one more try)
In love again

But you walked away when I needed you most
Now maybe baby, maybe baby

I found someone
To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone
Since you've been gone

Dry your eyes
I never could bear to see you cry
Someday your love will shine through
And show you the feelings that you never really knew

But baby don't you loose that thunder
Talking 'bout the fire in your eyes
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe
That maybe baby, maybe baby

To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness

Since you've been gone

Too long on the border line
Wondering if your love was really mine
But you left me with open eyes
And when I realized

Baby
I found someone
To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone
