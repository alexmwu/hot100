C'mon

Shawty had them apple bottom jeans(jeans)
Boots with the fur(with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor(she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps(with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack(hey)
She hit the floor(she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

I ain't never seen something that'll make me go
This crazy all night, spending my dough
Had the million dollar vibe and a body to go
Them birthday cakes, they stole the show

So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinking X&O
Hold up, wait a minute
Do I see what I think? Whoa

Did her thing seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain I'm making it snow
Work the pole I gotta bank roll

I'm gonna say that I prefer the no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me I gave her mo'
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it go

Shawty had them apple bottom jeans(jeans)
Boots with the fur(with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor(she hit the floor)
Next thing you know

She hit the floor(she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Hey shawty, what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans filled with guap and they're ready for showing
Cadillacs laid back for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan

One stack(come on), two stacks(come on), three stacks(come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I'm dealing rubber bands

That's when I threw her legs on my shoulders, I knew it was over
That Heny and cola got me like a soldier
She ready for rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky on me, I was just like clover

Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Apple bottom jeans(jeans)
Boots with the fur(with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor(she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Whoa shawty, yeah she was worth the money
Little mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that

I was zoned in sexy woman
Let me show it, make me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them rose bottles foaming

She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty dipped that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fine, just like my glock

Apple bottom jeans(jeans)
Boots with the fur(with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor(she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeah
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Ooh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love, oh

I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you

There ain't no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin' what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you,
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new

I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
It's too late to apologize, yeah,

Head under water
And they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder
Even I know that

You made room for me
But it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's
Make or breakin' this if you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay

If all you have is leavin'
I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today (Yeah)
Today, yeah

I learned the hard way
That they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart
Sinks deep down under you and your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm tryin' to let you hear me as I am

I'm not gonna write you a love song

Promise me (Ah, ah, ah)
That you'll leave the light on (Ah, ah, ah)
To help me see (Ah, ah, ah)
With daylight, my guide, gone (Ah, ah, ah)

'Cause I believe, there's a way (Ah, ah, ah)
You can love me because I say I won't write you a love song
'Cause you ask for it
'Cause you need one (Mhm)
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (ooh)

To write you a love song today (write you a love song today)

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain

This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

I can taste her on my tongue

The more I got the more I want
She wants to own me

I've been awake for a while now
You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go
I always know

I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should

This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one

This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

Well I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do

Not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you

Can't help it

First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me
Play it cool but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me

CHORUS:
You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love

Can't breathe when you touch me, see

Can't help it, the girl can't help it

You know this ain't the first time
This has happened to me, this love sick thing
I like serious relationships
And a girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug crawls right back up
And bites me and I'm back

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(In love)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh God)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it

Can't help it, the girl can't help it

Can't help it, the girl can't help it

Well, you dawned on me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours

Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours

Oh, oh, oh

No matter what you say about love, I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later
I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life, I learn every time I bleed
That truth is a stranger, my soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free
To admit that I'm wrong, and then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
(I'll always have you
I'll always have you)

I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry, but I've gotta be strong and leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
(I'll always have you)

If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
It's still a part of me and you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do

Oooh

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart, just like a tattoo

Never be tame

In another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes (I can't wait)

I st-st-stuttered when
You asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said
"Oh, she's just bein' Miley"
The next time we hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest 'til then
Whoa, whoa, I

When you called and asked to see me
Tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader
But I'm readin' the signs (That you can't wait)

I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands, just take the wheel
Every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're "here" not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'ma run 'til you can't walk
But something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh

(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down...

[T.I.]
Ay, this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here
What you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are(Rihanna, let's get it)

So live your life(hey)Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life(oh)Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life(hey)Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life(oh)Ay-ay-ay
(Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life(hey)Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life(oh)Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life(hey)Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life(oh)Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

[T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still'd grab a nigga by the collar quick

Whoever havin' problems with they record sales, just holla T.I.P.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow T.I.P.
I got love for the game, but ay, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comical

The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
"Where you from? Who you know? What you makin'? What kind of car you in?"
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into ya bank account, and you've up out of poverty

Your values is in disarrayed, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life(hey)Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life(oh)Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life(hey)Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life(oh)Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life,(ay)my life,(oh)my life(ay)
Just livin' my life,(ay)my life,(oh)my life(ay)

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin,' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin' nowhere

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
And look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
'Til the game end, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot

Livin' the life, my life
In a brand new city, got my whole team wit' me
The life, my life, I do what I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life, I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life and I'm not stopping

So live your life

She got somethin' to relax me when i'm under stress
Never told her, or let her know it but she the best
She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you had told me it was this good, i'da never guessed
She full of surprises, i don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep i sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My BUST IT BABY i keep 'er on deck

She got me speedin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor mayne, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang, ask around they know us

Kanye West:
Just another one champion sound
Me and Estelle about to get down (get down)
Who the hottest in the world right now?
Just touched down in London town.

Bet they give me a pound.
Tell them "Put the money in my hand right now." (Yes!)
Tell the promoter "We need more seats."
We just sold out all the floor seats

Estelle:
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see L.A.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy.

He said "Hey sister,
It's really, really nice to meet ya."
I just met this 5 foot 7 guy who's just my type.
I like the way he's speaking.
His confidence is peaking.

Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them.
And no I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York heart awaits.
First let's see the west end. I'll show you to my brethren.
I'm likin' this American boy. American boy.

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see L.A.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy. American boy.

Can we get away this weekend?
Take me to broadway.
Let's go shopping maybe then we'll go to a cafe.
Let's go on the subway.

Take me to your hood.
I neva' been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good.
Dressed in all your fancy clothes.
Sneakers looking fresh to death I'm lovin' those shell-toes.

Walkin' that walk.
Talk that slick talk.
I'm likin' this American boy. American boy.

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see L.A.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy.

Kanye West:
Who killin' 'em in the UK?
Everybody gonna to say you K, reluctantly,
Cause most of this press don't fuck wit me.
Estelle once said to me,

"Cool down down don't act a fool now now."
I always act a fool oww oww.
Ain't nothing new now now.

He crazy, I know what ya thinkin'.
Ribena I know what you're drinkin'.
Rap singer. Chain blinger.

Holla at the next chick soon as you're blinkin'.
What's your persona bout this Americana? Rhymer.
Am I shallow cuz' all my clothes designer?

Dressed smart like a London bloke.
Before he speak his suit be spoke.
And you thought he was cute before.
Look at this peacoat, tell me he's broke.

And I know you ain't into all that.
I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit.
But I still talk that ca-a-ash.
Cause a lot wags want to hear it.

And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest.
Like the Pips at they gladdest.
And I know they love it.
So to hell with all that rubbish.

Estelle:
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine would you be my love my love, could you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love?
Would you be my American boy? American boy.

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay.

You'll be my American boy. American boy.

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around
Turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, before I said, "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower

She'll buy her own, I dont think she'll never look
In a man face standin' waitin' for him to take care of her
She'd rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

(Chorus)

Lil Phat
She a dumb dime keeper, gutta like Keisha
Work that meat up, she a good freaker
She stay on her shit, she got her own shit
She don't never trip, all she want is that dick
She bossy flossy, keep them hoes off me
Gutta lil slang mane I love when she talkin
A independent chick, do u know what that mean?
She cook, she clean, never smell like onion rings
22s on her whip oh she do it large
And she break a nigga off got a nigga spoiled
She a bad lil chick, a fly lil chick
Hit me on my phone she like to buy that dick
Got her stunna shades lookin like something
Stallion hair long she a nice sumthing
She like to go to the mall everyday for a outfit
Hair did nails did independent wat she call that

(Chorus)

Lil Boosie
She got her own house, drive her own whip
Range Rover all white like her toe tips
She got a pretty smile
Smell real good
The only time she need mane for that good jugg
They buy the bar too
They superstars too
They be like you ain't got no money
Take you broke tell home
Baby Phat they on
They clothes match they phone
They be like yea!! When they song come on
Leave the club kinda early cuz they gotta go to work
I mess wit supervisors who got credit like Big Turk
So dusty feet please don't bother me
I got independent dimes on my mind who spoil me
Gucci hat, Gucci fit so sick
That's a gift from my independent chick yes sir
Tryna get next to her gotta be yourself mane
Cuz she got her own money
She don't need no help mane (Boosie)

If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?

If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for

I don't want to forget the present is a gift
And I don't want to take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again

Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh

How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for

When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Can you do that for me baby?

Every time you touch me
See we don't really know
Touch me like this is the last time
See everyday we never know

Promise that you'll love me
I want you to promise me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Like you'll never see me again

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Smoke us a cigarette

I was all in da club, havin' a drink, no one on the suite
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all on the bar when drifter Shawty Redd came over
Then she hit the floor, now

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips,
She's so right I'm gon' beat

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves although with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shit"

See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

And how life was
Just you and me and loving all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
Now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this

'Cause it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooo but I won't go

And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take 'em away
Oh but I'm taking 'em back
Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend this life we live
It's not what we have
It's what we believe in

It's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me

But it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a will in me
And now I know that
This could be the end of me

Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice you mean everything

Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings

If I'm dreaming don't wanna let it
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know time will heal it

Pimpin' got harder cos hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spending it like they wanna

They got they mind on the money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on their nines
See every day they feel the struggle, but stand on the grind
And ain't nobody take it from us, and that's the bottom line

But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know, how not to lay low
'cause 25 to life's no joke

To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful womens gettin' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all(dollar, dollar bill, yeah)

And if you make it rain she will be under the weather

She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by a school
She takes a loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her or pay up for the time used

And then she runs to the pastor(pastor)

But she feels no different after

The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before?
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core

But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed but I have loved you from the start

Oh, but hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's impossible

So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in
I'm yours to keep
And hold onto your words
'Cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight when you're asleep

Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
Just the way you're impossible to find

Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Walking like a one-man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead
If you could only

Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say

Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You better know that in the end
It's better to say too much

And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

(Chorus)
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

You believe and you doubt
You're confused, and got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

(Chorus)
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight (when you need to find the strength)
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time

(Chorus)
Take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

(Chorus)
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we

That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No...)

[Ne-Yo]
But you wont let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did

[Rihanna]
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong

[Ne-Yo]
But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Rihanna]
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you...)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oooh whoa...)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oooh...)

[Ne-Yo]
You completely know the power that you have
the only one that makes me laugh

[Rihanna]
Said and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right

And I hate how much I love you girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah...)
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak...
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me...

Yeaahhh... oohh...

That's how much I love you (how much I need you)
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
That's how much I love you (oh, need you)

And I hate that I love you soooo...
And I hate how much I love you boy
I can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you)

If you are what they say you are - a superstar

And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Matthew Santos
If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know

Lupe Fiasco
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Matthew Santos
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autographed picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha ha ha ha...ha

Matthew Santos
If you are what they say you are - a superstar

Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed

Make you come alive

Let it rock

When he cursed his name
Turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger

This 7H is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah, that's my bodyguard
Wear a lot of jewelery Young don't do security
It was whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate
If you want it come and get it
You know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin' at the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing Happy Birthday, yeah I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait
(Chorus)
I put on for my city, on on for my city
I put on for my city, on on for my city
Put on (east side)
Put on (south side)
Put on (west side)
Put on (x2)

Half bag, top back, ain't nothin' but a young thug
HKs, AKs, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps, you know I like it super sized
Passenger's a redbone, her weave look like some curly fries
Inside's fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that glock on me
Don't get caught without one, comin' from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton, flyin' down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene

(Chorus)

(Kanye)
I put on... (x3)
I put on for my city, I put on for my
I put on for my city, I put on for my city
On

I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit
'Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least one of Russell's nieces
On... I let my nightmares go
I put on, everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed homie
You can ask big homie, man the top sure lonely I ain't lyin'
So lonely I ain't lyin'
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)
'Cause every night every night
I put on

(Chorus)

Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)
'Cause every night every night
Let me see what we have tonight
I'm high as a satellite

I've been waitin' for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed was there all along
Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun

I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life...my life

More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
This is the time of my life
The time of my life
The time of my life

And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

Now look at that pepper on the back of that bumper
She ain't even playing when she's shaking that rumper
And oh, you ain't know she get lower than a muffler
Even with her girlfriends show stopping with a hustler

The way she move her body she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me tryna show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy always tight and never sloppy
And got her entourage and her own paparazzi

Now there she go again riding through the stormy weather
You better button up if you wanna go get her
'Cause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone

(It's a wrap)
When she break them boys off a typhoon
(It's a wrap)
Gotta get that phatty like a boss tycoon

(It's a wrap)
Now hold it steady 'cause she make a monsoon
(It's a wrap)
Now you can Google, download the iTunes

See what I'm saying, she ain't playing
Yeah, she got them heads turning
You gon' hear it clack, clack
When them heels get to burning
Stiletto so fuego, she got her own label
And got us all doing the tornado

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone

Shawty got looks and shawty got class
Shawty got hips and shawty got ass
When she hit the stage she drop it down low like

Ay! This is crazy, it's amazing!
It must be the way of the lady

Oh
Never find a love like this

Well we go back so far,
Swinging in your backyard,
All the things that we used to do.
We were cool back in high school
Ooh I really liked you,
Must've been your attitude.

And that's why you keep on runnin'
in and out of my mind.
As the years they all roll by,
Baby now I know why
I keep comin' back to you.

You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,
I'll never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say
Now we'll never be lonely,
Look at whatcha showed me,
I'll never find a love like this.

When this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep callin' me back to your heart.
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me,
Wrap your world around me,
You'll never find a love like this.

All the guys tried to take me,
You're the one who saved me,
I feel like I owe you my life.
And as strange as it may seem,
I'll go if you take me,
I'm willing to sacrifice.

That's why you keep on runnin'
in and out of my mind.
As the years they all roll by,
It's not hard to know why,
I keep comin back to you.

You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,

Wrap your world around me,
You'll never find a love like this.

Me never find a lo lo lo love like this,
That still make me think about my middle school kiss.
I sit here in this chair and I wish,
For you not to leave me now.
My friends they always told me
Not to make you my wifey,
Man they was puttin' you down.
And now they see we rollin',
Me and you we strollin',
They don't wanna come around.

Let me hear you say,
You're the only one that knows me,
Love it when you hold me,
I'll never find a love like this.
Let me hear you say
Now we'll never be lonely,
Look at whatcha showed me,

You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Come on, girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Staring me down
I know you feel it too

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'ma trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Said we're burnin' up in this place tonight
The brothers singing loud (and we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (don't try and fight it)
Big Rob is for real (and that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (and touch the floor)
It keeps on burnin' up (more and more)
I got JB with me laying it down
Come on boys, bring the chorus around

I'm slipping into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeah)

I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never, never know
Never know enough, til it's over, love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin no, no, no, no, no
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keeping ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through
You lose, you lose
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now You keep ya love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin, keep the lovin gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to

So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Now keep ya love locked down, you lose, you lose, you lose

Da da da da

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps until I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine
Valentine

Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours, too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

Kanye West and T-Pain:
Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
I go, go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I'mma get on the TV momma, I'mma
I'mma put shit down)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
Ahh (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good, y'all pop the trunk
I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods, and she got that ass
I got to look, sorry
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I'mma get on this TV momma, I'mma
I'mma put shit down)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
'Cause they got mo' ass than the models
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
'Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like DC
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ay, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homey, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood? (Welcome to the good life)
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life)
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life"

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I'mma get on this TV momma, I'mma

Ay, (Ay), Ay, (Ay)
Ay, (Ay), Ay, (I'm good)

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While gettin' some brain?
Whipped it out, she said, "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
'Cause (The good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

T-Pain:
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama
Ain't the only girl callin' me, "Baby"
If you feelin' me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Hey, hey, ooh I'm good

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go!"
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go!"
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes."

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

You know I love music
And every time I hear something hot
It makes me wanna move
It makes me wanna have fun
But it's something about this joint right here
This joint right here
Its makes me wanna.....Woooh

Let it go...
Can't let this thing called love get away from you
Feel free right now, go do what you want to do
Can't let nobody take it away, from you, from me, from we
No time for moping around, are you kidding?
And no time for negative vibes, cause I'm winning
It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my vibe right
I aint gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine

Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
Keep your head up high
In yourself, believe in you, believe in me
Having a really good time, I'm not complaining
And I'm a still wear a smile if it's raining
I got to enjoy myself regardless
I appreciate life, I'm so glad that it's fine

So I like what I see when I'm looking at me

When I'm walking past the mirror
Aint worried about you and what you gonna do
I'm a lady so I must stay classy
Got to keep it hot, keep it together
If I want to get better
See I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
See I won't change my life, my life's just fine

I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
(I ain't gone let nobody bring me down, no, no, no)
No matter what nobody has to say
(No way, no way, no way)
I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
No matter what nobody has to say

Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
It's a really good thing to say

It was 1989
My thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in between
It was summertime in northern Michigan

Splashing through the sandbar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Turn it up

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves begin to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

We were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

With those tears runnin down your cheeks
But what can I do
I gotta stay true
Cause deep down I'm still a G

And I don't want to come between you and your man

Till you see you for what you really are

And I can't help but wait

It aint fresh to just let him call the shots
You're a queen you should be
Gettin all that someone's got
You should be rockin the latest in purses
Bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than that occasional
"I love you, I'm thinking of you"

Till you see that with me it ain't the same

So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time
And you know he's gonna be there

Backed a border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

After many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones
Without reading innuendos

But you found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifter's run has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Imma tell you what you do to thank you
Practice what you preach
Now I know, there's nothing we can't reach

'Cause a heart can't erase
Once it finds a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Take me away...

A way through the day
A light for the night
Dear lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?

The Game
We are not the same, I am a Martian.
So approach my Phantom doors with caution.
You see them 24's spinnin'
I earned 'em.
I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson 'cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn I know his mama proud
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like MJB, no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it outta town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty, like a glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

Lil Wayne
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A light for the night
Dear lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?

The Game
Walked through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on
Me and the devil sharing chronic blunts
Listening to The Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, and my Sox hat
I'm Paid in Full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

Lil Wayne
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A light for the night
Dear, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?

My Life (my life, my life, my life)
My Life (my life, my life, my life)
My Life (my life, my life, my life)
My Life (my life, my life, my life)

Ohhh....
Remember...
Ohhh, I remember...
I wanna know...

(Verse 1:)
Where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you.
Thinking of all the times we shared.

(Chorus:)
I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
I'm sad and lonely.

(Verse 2:)
No one knew all the pain I went through.
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you.
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be.
But you made me leave.
And plus my heart it just,it kept telling me so.

(Chorus:)
I remember when my heart broke.


I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
So sad and lonely.

(Bridge:)
There was nowhere else to go, oh.
Nobody else to turn to, no.
For the rest of my life, I promised myself I will love me first genuinely.

(Chorus:)
I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I said I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
Sad and lonely.

I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
So sad and lonely, hey.
I remember when I stormed out.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
I was sad and lonely.

Kanye West:
She don't believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like, "I love to start shit"
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

I know it's been a while sweetheart, we hardly talk, I was doing my thang
I know it was foul, baby, aye babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago, fronting though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago, it'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A., like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa, first class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared

It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear, my dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know and
The seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
What I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear,
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know and
The seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine, when we're intertwined
Everything's all right
I wanna be with the one I know

And the seventh thing I like the most that you do (Ohh)
You make me love you

She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining, saying "I can't wait to turn 18"
She said, "I'll make my own money and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school"
And she kissed her head and said, "I was just like you"

You're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it, she's a brand new bride
In her one bedroom apartment and her daddy stops by
He tells her it's a nice place, she says it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
And daddy shakes his head and says "baby, just slow down"

'Cause you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing, one kid's crying, one kid's screaming
And she keeps apologizing, he says "they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own, one's 36, one's 23"
Huh, it's hard to believe

But you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this, yeah, you're gonna miss this

A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like lunar landing
You make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

I find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz sounds just like a 'fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
It's all left still to play

We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we're over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change

I, oh I
I wish this could last forever

As if we could last forever

Love remains the same

I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right...

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do

I never felt like this before
Just when I leave I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that

Never last strong as it used to,

Ooooh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before

When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

When love won't let you, walk away
You can't help who you lust
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

(CHORUS)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

Everybody say
I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say
I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say
I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say
I wanna be the one who
I wanna be the one who's (sent from above)

(CHORUS:)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when your gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
