56@Tim McGraw@Please Remember Me@When all our tears have reached the sea. Part of you will live in me. Way down deep inside my heart. The days keep coming without fail. A new wind is gonna find your sail. That's where your journey starts.  You'll find better love, Strong as it ever was, Deep as the river runs, Warm as the morning sun. Please remember me.  Just like the waves down by the shore, We're gonna keep on coming back for more. Cause we don't ever wanna stop. Out in this brave new world you seek O'er the valleys and the peaks And I can see you on the top.  You'll find better love, Strong as it ever was, Deep as the river runs, Warm as the morning sun. Please remember me.  Remember me when you're out walking When snow falls high outside your door Late at night when you're not sleeping And moonlight falls across your floor. I can't hurt you anymore.  Repeat Chorus.

(You can achieve) When you believe, somehow you will, you will when you believe  They don't always happen when you ask And it's easy to give in to your fears Ohh, but when you're blinded by your pain Can't see your way clear through the rain A small, but still resilient voice says hope is very near  There can be miracles Miracles When you believe Boy, when you believe, ohh Though hope is frail, it's hard... Hard to kill, yeah  Who knows what miracles you can achieve? You can achieve, ohh When you believe, somehow you will Somehow, somehow, somehow  Somehow you will I know, I know, know You will when you believe When you believe...  Ohh, you will when you... You will when you believe Just believe You will, you will Just believe You will when you believe
100@Alabama feat. 'N Sync@God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You@Alabama & N Sync Lyrics by:  Evan Rogers, Carl Sturken  Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real? How can I put into words how I feel? My life was complete, I thought I was whole. Why do I feel like I'm losing control?  I never thought that love could feel like this. Then you changed my world with just one kiss. How can it be, that right here with me, there's an angel, it's a miracle.  Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep. Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep. When I look into your eyes I know that it's true, God must have spent a little more time on you.  In all of creation,  all things great and small, You are the one that surpasses them all. More precious than any diamond or pearl, They broke the mold when you came in this world.  And I'm trying hard to figure out Just how I ever did without. The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child, It's deep inside, and leaves me purified.  Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep. Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep. When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true, God must have spent a little more time on you.  I never thought that love could feel like this, then you changed my world with just one kiss. How can it be, that right here with me, There's an angel, it's a miracle.  Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep. Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep. When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true, God must have spent a little more time on you. God must have spent a little more time on you.
