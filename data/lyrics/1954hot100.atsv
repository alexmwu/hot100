Chorus: Val-deri,Val-dera, Val-deri, Val-dera-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha Val-deri,Val-dera. My knapsack on my back.  I love to wander by the stream That dances in the sun, So joyously it calls to me, "Come! Join my happy song!"  I wave my hat to all I meet, And they wave back to me, And blackbirds call so loud and sweet From ev'ry green wood tree.  High overhead, the skylarks wing, They never rest at home But just like me, they love to sing, As o'er the world we roam.  Oh, may I go a-wandering Until the day I die! Oh, may I always laugh and sing, Beneath God's clear blue sky!
