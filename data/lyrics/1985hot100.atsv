Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is the hole you find

Should have known better, yeah
Oh, oh

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all it's sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
(Should have known better, yeah)
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ooh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

(Now that you're gone)Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone)Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?

Shiny and new

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

I'd better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Up through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Oh, oh, ooh

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Living in the middle between the two extremes

Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't use them so much, yeah

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world

Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smoky air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close, but still a world away
What I'm dying to say is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye, we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath, I'm deeper into you
Soon we too are standing still in time
If you read my mind

You'll see I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true

What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I say there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running around in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling, that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night

You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love, that's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But do be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go 'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden, it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmmm

It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' till you feel

You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of love

Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand, you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
For time is passing by

I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (oh)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side

I often pray before I lay down by your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night?

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (Baby, yeah)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
(Let's cherish every moment we have together)
For as long as we both shall live
(Hand in hand, you and I)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

(Spoken:)
Cherish the love
Cherish the life

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
(Let's cherish every moment we have together)
We should cherish the life we live
(Hand in hand, you and I)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Growin' up
You don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by
Movin' straight ahead, you knew it all

But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone
Everything has changed

Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on
Only you can do what must be done

You know in some way
You're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner
And you're tryin' to break free

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire, ooh

Burnin' up
Don't know just how far that I can go(just how far I go)
Soon be home
Only just a few miles down the road

I can make it
I know I can
You broke the boy in me
But you won't break the man

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's Fire
Burnin' in me, burnin' in me

Just once in his life
A man has his time
And my time is now
I'm comin' alive

I can hear the music playin'
I can see the banners fly
Feel like your man again
And hope ridin' high

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's Fire burnin' in me

Burnin'
Burnin' in me
I can feel it burnin'
Ooh, burnin' inside of me

The heat is on, on the street
Inside your head, on every beat
And the beat's so loud, deep inside
The pressure's high, just to stay alive
'Cause the heat is on

Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it

The heat is on, the heat is on

The heat is on, the heat is on (oh yeah)
The heat is on (burnin' burnin' burnin')
Oh it's on the street
The heat is... on

The shadows are on the darker side
Behind those doors, it's a wilder ride
You can make a break, you can win or lose
That's a chance you take, when the heat's on you
When the heat is on

Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it

The heat is on, the heat is on (oh yeah)
The heat is on (burnin' burnin' burnin')
It's on the street (woo-hoo)
The heat is on (I can feel the fire)
The heat is on (Flames are burnin' higher)
The heat is on (Baby can't you feel it?)
Yeah it's on the street (woo-hoo)
The heat is on (I can feel the fire)
The heat is on (Flames are burnin' higher)

Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really, really ought to know

Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout, shout, let it all out(break your heart)
These are the things I can do without(I'd really love to break your heart)

Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong
With part-time lover

If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you
My part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word "discreet"
With part-time lovers

But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek to you
My part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you
My part-time lover

And then a man caught our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers

You and me
Part-time lovers
But she and he
Part-time lovers

You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist
Being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try
I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling, when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night
For feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love, yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night
That I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through

The sun goes down, the night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up and the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls

You're out of your room and down on the street
Movin' through the crowd in the midnight heat
The traffic roars and the sirens scream
You look at the faces, it's just like a dream

Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves, it's in your blood
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye, you were on the run
Tryin' to get away from the things you'd done
Now you're back again and you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves, it's in your blood
You're a man of the street

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it

You can hear it
You're getting near it
You're gonna make it
'Cause you can take it(ooh)

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night

You belong

When it feels like the world is on your shoulders,
And all of the madness has got you going crazy.
It's time to get out, step out into the street,
Where all of the action is right there at your feet,
well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away
Underneath electric stars
Just come with me and we can shake your blues right away,
You'll be doing fine when the music starts, oh

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light.
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night,
Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah

Look out on the street now, the party's just beginning,
The music's playing, a celebration's starting
Under the street lights the scene is being set
A night for romance, a night you won't forget
So, come join the fun, this ain't no time to be staying home,
Ooh, there's too much going on
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known.
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long.

So if I stumble and if I fall, just help me back,

Please give me one more night,
give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'cos I can't wait forever

Please give me one more night,
just give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'cos I can't wait forever

I've been sitting here so long, just wasting time,
just staring at the phone
And always wondering, should I call you,

Oh please give me one more night,

Like a river to the sea,
I will always be with you
And if you sailed away
I would follow you

To give me one more night,
just give me that one more night
One more night,
'cos I can't wait forever

I know there'll never be a time
you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind,
you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

Ah give me just one more night,
give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'cos I can't wait forever

Just give me one more night,

Meeting you
With a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places
Feel the chill

Nightfall covers me
But you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea
Could it be the whole Earth opening wide?

A sacred why
A mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sound of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you
Is a view to a kill
Between the shades
Assassination standing still

First crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years
To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

Again we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sound of broken dreams

Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
When all we see is the view to a kill

The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us,
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell

They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

Many times I've tried to tell you
Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit
Do we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best to try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say

We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong, we belong
We belong together

How can I convince you, what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyes

Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely
Since you've been away
I've been thinking of you
Trying to understand
The reason you left me
What were you going through?
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
As I look around
I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile
Made my heart fill with joy
I'll still recall
All those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to, boy?
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Sometimes I've wondered
I didn't understand
Just where you were trying to go
Only you knew the plan
And I tried to be there
But you wouldn't let me in
But now you've gone away boy

I feel so broken hearted
I knew the day we started
That we were meant to be
If only you'd let me!
I've cried so many tears
Gotta face now all my fears
We let time slip away
I need you boy
Here today!
There was so much you gave me
To my heart
To my soul
There was so much of your dreams
That were never told
You had so much hope
For a brighter day
Why were you my flower
Plucked away
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Ooh ooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns

I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if i had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause this love is everlasting

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above,
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Ooh yeah

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough
To say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before,
Now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Each day I pray, this love affair would last forever
Oh hoh
Suddenly, Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above,
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, suddenly you're in love

Ooh

Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house, though I know you're not home

But I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow, and smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, "don't look back, you can never look back"
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the radio on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

The American
Bangkok, Oriental Setting
But the city don't know what the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies - doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tyrolean spa had the chess boards in it
All changed, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings
Or
Or this place!

Company
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me

The American
One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother

Company
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board not looking at the city

The American
Whattaya mean?!
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town

Company
T-girls1, warm and sweet (sweet)
Some are set up
In the Somerset Maugham suite

The American
Get Thai'd, you're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest:
"I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine"

Company
One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

The American
Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddha

But thank God I'm only watching the game
Controlling it

I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

So, you better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlors

Company
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me

One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time

We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion, their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Is it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond Thunderdome

All the children say
(We don't need another hero)
We don't need another hero

Yeah
Come on

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by ya
Make you look like a fool, boy

Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in; he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Alright!

Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back at school she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed

Her and her husband Bobby, well, they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying she starts laughing thinking about

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Oooh!

I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink 'til I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will

Yeah, just sittin' back trying to recapture
A little of the glory, yeah
Well, the time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister
But boring stories of

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Well alright, ooh, yeah
Well alright (Alright), come on now
Well alright (Alright), ooh, yeah
Well alright (Alright), come on now

Oooh
Ooohooo

Alright, boys, keep it rocking now!
Keep on goin'

I'm in the dark, I'd like to read his mind
But I'm frightened of the things I might find
Oh, there must be something he's thinking of
To tear him away-a-ay
When I tell him that I'm falling in love
Why does he say-a-ay

Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Uh-ah

I try so hard not to get upset
Because I know all the trouble I'll get
Oh, he tells me tears are something to hide
And something to fear-eh-eh
And I try so hard to keep it inside
So no one can hear

Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Uh-ah

Oh!
He wants me, but only part of the time
He wants me, if he can keep me in line

Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, shut up now, voices carry

Ever had that feeling
Almost broke in two
Said that you were leaving
Like you do, you do

All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears, in tears

Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near

Never had that feeling
Until I first met you
Never felt like kneeling
Now I do, yes I do
Yes, I do, ooh

Day or night, I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill
Of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right

No more lonely nights, never be another

Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire

I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us

I've been holding back the night
I've been searching for a clue from you
I'm gonna try with all my might
To make this story line come true

Can you feel me tremble when we touch?
Can you feel the hands of fate
Reaching out to both of us?
This love affair can't wait

I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
Your voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl, it's too late to turn back now

Another shooting star goes by
And in the night the silence speaks to you and I
And now the time has come at last
Don't let the moment run too fast

I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us

And there's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams

Bought it at the Five and Dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Hey!

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life - Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69

Ohh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

Yay!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life - Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69 - Uh hu-huh
It was the summer of '69 - Ohh yeah

Tell me I'm a baby and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

I don't want your freedom

You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do
Bet you someday baby someone says the same to you

Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart
How can I explain the meaning of her love?
It fits so tight, closer than a glove

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong?
'Cause I felt it all along

I can see your face in the mirrors of my mind
Will you still be there?
We're really not so clever as we seem to think we are
We've always got our troubles, so we solve them in the bar
As the days go by we seem to drift apart
If I could only find a way to keep hold of your heart

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wondering if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong?
'Cause I felt it all along

Sitting in the valley as I watch the sun go down
I can see you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart

She calls me up and says, "Baby it's a lonely ol' night.
I don't know I'm just so scared and lonely all at the same time."
Nobody told us it was gonna work out this way, no, no, no, no, no
I guess they knew we'd work it out in our own way

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you?
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

Radio playing softly some singer's sad, sad song
He's singing about standing in the shadows of love
I guess he feels awfully alone
She says, I know exactly what he means
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And it's a sad, sad, sad, sad feeling
When you're living on those in-betweens
But it's okay

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you?
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

She calls me Baby
She calls everybody Baby
It's a lonely ol' night, but ain't they all

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you?
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
Custom made for two lonely people like me and you

Yeah, like me and you

I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well
On the way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only want to share it with you
You might need it someday

I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing and you got to
Look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?
I only want to share it with you
What about love?
Don't you want someone to care about you?
What about love?
Don't let it slip away
What about love?

Well, east coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the southern girls, with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

The midwest farmers' daughters
Really make you feel alright
And the northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night
I dig the girls

I wish they all could be California(wooh)
I wish they all could be California(wow)
I wish they all could be California girls

The west coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaii island coast
By a palm tree in the sand

I been all around this great big world
And I've seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the States
Back to the cutest girls in the world
I dig the girls

I wish they all could be California(wow)

I don't mind

Why don't you do what you do
When you did what you did to me?
Love was so good that it filled up all my needs

I was crazy for you
You were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
My love, sweet love

Why don't you say what you say
When you say what you said anymore?
Your eyes couldn't lie
So long goodbye, close the door

I was crazy for you
You were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
My love, sweet love

Tell me something I didn't do
Why did someone else have to pull you through?
Did they steal you away like a thief in the night?
Love like this must take flight

Why don't they play what they played
On the nights you danced with me?
Remember the one we made love to endlessly

I was crazy for you
You were crazy for me
And how could something so right go so wrong
My love, sweet love

Why don't you do what you do
When you did what you did to me?
Do what you do when you did what you did to me
Do what you do when you did what you did to me
Do what you do when you did what you did to me

Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
End up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just to cover it up, now

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A., now

Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hands
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.

Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, "Son, if it was up to me..."
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, "Son, don't you understand, now?"

Oh yea
Oh no
No, no,no

I had a brother at Khe Sahn
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms, now

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
Ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A., now
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A., now

Born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A., now

Oh no

95@Sting@Fortress Around Your Heart

Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers in beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding through the night

It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
Had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long, for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead

While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
Had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

The prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon

As I returned to cross the lands I'd known
I recognized the fields where I'd once played
Had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

Girl, a love like yours is hard to resist

Penny lover you're my one desire
Tell me baby now could this be true
That I can need someone
Like I need you

Nights, warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl, I surrender
What more can I do

I spent all of my life
In search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl, I'd do anything just please stay
oh oh oh oh oh

Penny love don't you walk on by
Penny lover you're my one desire
Tell me baby now could this be true
That I can need someone
Like I need you

I don't understand it
Oh what's come over me
And I'm not gonna worry
No, not anymore..

Cause when a man's in love he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
Girl, a love like yours is hard to resist

Saw you dancin' out at Madame Wong Two's
You did the same two steps
That I taught you back in June
Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Cafe
Did you get your fill
Did you think you had to pay

Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the pain
And I'm sure it's the same
You feel again and again
And I wish I could get us
That second chance
But you're having too much fun
With your sudden romance
