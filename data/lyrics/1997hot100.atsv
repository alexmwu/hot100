1@Elton John@Candle In The Wind 1997@Goodbye England's rose May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed itself Where lives were torn apart  You called out to our country And you whispered to those in pain Now you belong to heaven And the stars spell out your name  And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in  And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend never will  Loveliness we've lost These empty days without your smile This torch, we'll always carry For our nation's golden child  And even though we try The truth brings us to tears All our words cannot express The joy you brought us through the years  And it seems to me you've lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in  And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend never will  Goodbye England's rose May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed yourselves Where lives were torn apart  Goodbye England's rose From a country lost without your soul Who'll miss the wings of your compassion More than you will ever know  And it seems to me you've lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in  And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend ever will  And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend ever will

17@Third Eye Blind@Semi-Charmed Life@I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling, she's living She's golden, she lives for me Says she lives for me Ovation, her own motivation She comes 'round, and she goes down on me  And I make her smile like a drug for you Do ever what you want to do, coming over you Keep on smiling, what we go through One stop to the rhythm that divides you  And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse Chop another line like a coda with a curse Come on like a freak show takes the stage We give them the games we play, she said  I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye  The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there Smiling in the pictures you would take  Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given And I bumped again, and then I bumped again I said  How do I get back there To the place where I fell asleep inside you? How do I get myself back to the place where you said  I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say goodbye  I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right, all right  And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing The velvet, it rips in the city We tripped on the urge to feel alive Now I'm struggling to survive Those days you were wearing that velvet dress You're the priestess, I must confess Those little red panties they pass the test Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress  One, and you hold me And we are broken Still it's all that I want to do Just a little now  Feel myself hovering off the ground I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile But nothing is all right, all right  And I want something else to get me through this life, baby I want something else, not listening when you say Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there In the place we used to start  I want something else
18@Duncan Sheik@Barely Breathing@I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears You really had me going, wishing on a star But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far  I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why I say goodbye  'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay  And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about? I used to be so certain and I can't figure out What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame Will it ever change?  'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay But I'm thinking it over anyway I'm thinking it over anyway  I've come to find I may never know Your changing mind, is it friend or foe I rise above or sink below With every time you come and go Please don't come and go  'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay But I'm thinking it over anyway I'm thinking it over anyway  I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear

70@R. Kelly@Gotham City@I'm looking over the skyline of the city. How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime. How next door to happiness lives sorrow, And signals of solution in the sky.  (chorus) A city of justice, a city of love, a city of peace for everyone of us. We all need it, can't live without it A Gotham City (oh yeah)  How sleeping awake because of fear. (ohh yeah) How children are drowning in their tears. How we need a place where we can go, A land where every one will have a hero (even me)  (chorus 2x)  Yet in the middle of stormy weather, We won't stumble and we won't fall. I know a place where all this shelter..  (repeat chorus until end)

And as you journey into outer-space, may the angels help to lead the way. May the prayers that the families made, shine up on your soul to keep you safe.

89@Michael Bolton@Go The Distance@I have often dreamed, of a far off place, Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me, Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face, And a voice keeps saying, "this is where I'm meant to be."  I'll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way, if I can be strong, I know every mile, will be worth my while, When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong.  Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you, And a thousand years, would be worth the wait It may take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through.  And I won't look back, I can go the distance And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete  But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part For a hero's strength is measured by his heart  Like a shooting star, I will go the distance I will search the world, I will face its harms I don't care how far, I can go the distance Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms  I will search the world, I will face its harms, Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms
