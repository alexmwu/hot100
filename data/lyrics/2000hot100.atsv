1@Faith Hill@Breathe@I can feel the magic floating in the air Being with you gets me that way I watch the sunlight dance across your face And I've never been this swept away All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms The whole world just fades away The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart  Cause I can feel you breathe It's washing over me And suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to prove Baby all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe Just breathe  In a way I know my heart is waking up As all the walls come tumbling down Closer than I've ever felt before And I know, and you know There's no need for words right now  Cause I can feel you breathe It's washing over me And suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to prove Baby all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe Just breathe  Caught up in the touch Slow and steady rush Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be? I can feel you breathe, just breathe I can feel the magic floating in the air Being with you gets me that way

11@Creed@Higher@When dreaming I'm guided to another world Time and time again At sunrise I fight to stay asleep 'Cause I don't want to leave The comfort of this place 'Cause there's a hunger A longing to escape From the life I live, when I'm awake  So let's go there Let's make our escape Come on, let's go there Let's ask, "Can we stay?"  Can you take me higher To a place where blind men see? Can you take me higher To a place with golden streets?  Although I would like our world to change It helps me to appreciate Those nights and those dreams But my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights If I could make the earth and my dreams the same The only difference is To let love replace all our hate  So let's go there Let's make our escape Come on, let's go there Let's ask, "Can we stay?"  Can you take me higher To a place where blind men see? Can you take me higher To a place with golden streets?  So let's go there Let's make our escape Come on, let's go there Let's ask, "Can we stay?"

Can you take me higher To a place with golden streets?  Can you take me higher To a place where blind men see? Can you take me higher To a place with golden streets?

35@Nine Days@Absolutely (Story Of A Girl)@This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her when she smiles  How many days in a year? She woke up with hope, but she only found tears And I can be so insincere Making her promises, never for real As long as she stands there waiting Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes How many days disappear? When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?  Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way You never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her when she smiles  Now how many lovers would stay Just to put up with this shit day after day? How did we wind up this way? Watching our mouths for the words that we say As long as we stand here waiting Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose How do we get there today? When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes  Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way But you never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looked so sad and lonely there I absolutely love her when she smiles  Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way You never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her  This is the story of a girl Her pretty face, she hid from the world And while she looked so sad and lonely there I absolutely love her  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her when she smiles When she smiles
