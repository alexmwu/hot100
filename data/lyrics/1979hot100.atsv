40@Kenny Rogers@The Gambler@On a warm summer's evenin' On a train bound for nowhere I met up with the gambler We were both too tired to sleep So we took turns a-starin' Out the window at the darkness When boredom overtook us He began to speak  He said, "Son, I've made my life Out of readin' people's faces Knowin' what the cards were By the way they held their eyes So if you don't mind my sayin' I can see you're out of aces For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"  So I handed him my bottle And he drank down my last swallow Then he bummed a cigarette And asked me for a light And the night got deathly quiet And his face lost all expression He said, "If You're gonna play the game, boy You gotta learn to play it right"  You've got to know When to hold 'em Know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away Know when to run You never count your money When you're sittin' at the table There'll be time enough for countin' When the dealin's done  Now every gambler knows The secret to survivin' Is knowin' what to throw away And knowin' what to keep 'Cause every hand's a winner And every hand's a loser And the best you can hope for Is to die in your sleep"  And when he finished speakin' He turned back toward the window Crushed out his cigarette And faded off to sleep And somewhere in the darkness The gambler - he broke even And in his final words I found An ace that I could keep  You've got to know When to hold 'em Know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away Know when to run You never count your money When you're sittin' at the table There'll be time enough for countin' When the dealin's done  You've got to know When to hold 'em Know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away Know when to run You never count your money When you're sittin' at the table There'll be time enough for countin' When the dealin's done

47@Kenny Rogers@She Believes In Me@While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs And sometimes all the nights can be so long And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light And quietly she says how was your night? And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight  And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I will find a way, find a way...  While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite Then I see my old guitar in the night Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two And I'm torn between the things that I should do And she says to wake her up when I am through, God her love is true...  And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me

49@Frank Mills@Music Box Dancer@You walk in the room and you're wearing a frown You reach for the shelf and cradle it down The Music Box Dancer, what does it prove Only that you need to see a statue that moves A tutu of satin, bordered with lace Slender lines, agile legs, a wonderland face Her beauty is balanced, an immovable pose Eternally destined to remain on her toes  Music Box Dancer, she is only a toy Project upon her your dreams of wanting life's joy She's perched on her stand, and never will part A final gaze upon her, now the music will start  You wind the doll up, it's nostalgic because You've been here before, so give one final pause To dream of the future, to reflect on the past Music Box Dancer start your whirling at last  The room fills with music, such a cute song Watching her go 'round and 'round, she's where she belongs Bring joy to the watchers, spreading a glow Whenever wound up, she'll put on a good show  Music Box Dancer, do you think or believe She could step off her box if she wanted to leave So easy it is, twirl around with such grace Staying in her circle, she remains in one place  Such a brief moment, a small time to spend The dancing will slow soon, the music will end In real life we're plastic, nature's unfair How can we breathe life, how can we share The knowledge and insights hidden in tombs We're all Music Box Dancers all alone in our rooms We sit on our shelves where objects reside We don't allow the music to get right inside  Music Box Dancer's now completely alone No winder or no listener, because nobody's home How long before someone will re-wind the spring? The room will now be witness; and silence can't sing
50@Charlie Daniels Band@The Devil Went Down To Georgia@The devil went down to Georgia He was lookin' for a soul to steal He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind He was willin' to make a deal  When he came across this young man Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump And said: "Boy, let me tell you what  I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you"  The boy said: "My name's Johnny and it might be a sin But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret 'Cause I'm the best there's ever been!"  Johnny, rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard 'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold But if you lose the devil gets your soul  The devil opened up his case and he said: "I'll start this show" And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow Then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this  When the devil finished Johnny said: "Well, you're pretty good old son But sit down in that chair right there And let me show you how it's done"  Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run The devil's in the house of the rising sun Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no  The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet Johnny said: "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again 'Cause I've told, you once you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been!"  And he played Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run The devil's in the house of the rising sun Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

100@Firefall@Strange Way@Didn't I hear you cry this morning, didn't I feel you weep? Teardrops flowin' down on me, like rivers in my sleep. And in my dream of laughter, you came creepin' with your fears. Telling me your sorrows, in the tracings of your tears.  That's a strange way to tell me you love me When your sorrow is all I can see If you just want to cry to somebody, don't cry to me, no Don't cry to me, no  Didn't I hear your voice this morning, didn't you call my name? I heard you whisper softly, but the words were never plain. And in your dream of darkness, I came shinin' like the sun. Waiting for the laughter, but the laughter never comes.  That's a strange way to tell me you love me When your sorrow is all I can see If you just want to cry to somebody, dont cry to me, no Dont cry to me, no  Didn't you feel alone this morning, didn't you need a friend? And in your darkest hour, you came runnin' back again  That's a strange way to tell me you love me That's a strange way to tell me you love me That's a strange way to tell me you love me
