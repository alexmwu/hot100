35@Dan Fogelberg@Leader Of The Band@An only child, alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son, His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none. He left his home and went his lone and solitary way And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay.  A quiet man of music, denied a simpler fate, He tried to be a soldier once but his music wouldn't wait. He earned his love through discipline, a thund'ring, velvet hand. His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand  The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul. My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man. I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band.  My brothers' lives were different, for they heard another call. One went to Chicago and the other to Saint Paul And I'm in Colorado, when I'm not in some hotel Living out this life I've chosen, come to know so well.  I thank you for the music and your stories of the road I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough And, Papa, I don't think I said "I love you" near enough.  The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul. My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man. I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band. I am the living legacy to the leader of the band.

All the voices in your head calling, Gloria? Gloria, don't you think you're fallin'? If everybody wants you, why isn't anybody callin'?

76@Elton John@Empty Garden@What happened here, As the New York sunset disappeared? I found an empty garden among the flagstones there. Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot, Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop. And now it all looks strange. It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain.  And what's it for, This little empty garden by the brownstone door? And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more. Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot, Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop. And we are so amazed! We're crippled and we're dazed A gardener like that one, no one can replace.  And I've been knocking, but no one answers. And I've been knocking, most all the day. Oh and I've been calling, oh hey, hey, Johnny! Can't you come out to play?  And through their tears, Some say he farmed his best in younger years. But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear. Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot, Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop. Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls We hear, we hear your name  And I've been knocking, but no one answers. And I've been knocking, most all the day. Oh and I've been calling, oh hey, hey, Johnny! Can't you come out to play?  And I've been knocking, but no one answers. And I've been knocking, most all the day. Oh and I've been calling, oh hey, hey, Johnny! Can't you come out, can't you come out to play?  Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden? Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden?  What happened here, As the New York sunset disappeared? Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden?  And what's it for, This little empty garden by the brownstone door? Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden?  Johnny? Can't you come out to play, in your empty garden? Johnny? Can't you come out to play?

93@Michael Murphy@What's Forever For@I've been looking at people And how they change with the times And lately all I've been seeing are people Throwing love away and losing their minds  Maybe it's me that's gone crazy But I can't understand out why All these lovers keep hurting each other When good love is so hard to come by  So what's the glory in living Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore And if love never lasts forever Tell me what's forever For  I see love hungry people Tryin' their best to survive When right there in their hands is a dying romance And their not even tryin' to keep it alive  So, what's the glory in living Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore And if love never lasts forever Tell me what's forever for  So, what's the glory in living Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore And if love never lasts forever Tell me what's forever for
94@Rolling Stones@Waiting On A Friend@Watching girls passing by It ain't the latest thing I'm just standing in a doorway I'm just trying to make some sense Out of these girls passing by The tales they tell of men I'm not waiting on a lady I'm just waiting on a friend  A smile relieves a heart that grieves Remember what I said I'm not waiting on a lady I'm just waiting on a friend I'm just waiting on a friend Just waiting on a friend I'm just waiting on a friend I'm just waiting on a friend Just waiting on a friend  Don't need a whore Don't need no booze Don't need a virgin priest But I need someone I can cry to I need someone to protect Making love and breaking hearts It is a game for youth But I'm not waiting on a lady I'm just waiting on a friend I'm just waiting on a friend Just waiting on a friend Waiting on a friend I'm just waiting on a friend Just waiting on a friend Waiting on a friend Waiting on a friend

The best that you can do is fall in love  Arthur he does as he pleases All of his life, he's mastered choice Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy Living his life one day at a time And showing himself a really good time Laughing about the way they want him to be  When you get caught between the Moon and New York City I know it's crazy, but it's true If you get caught between the Moon and New York City The best that you can do ..... The best that you can do is fall in love  When you get caught between the Moon and New York City I know it's crazy, but it's true If you get caught between the Moon and New York City The best that you can do .....
