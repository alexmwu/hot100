Gotye:
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Kimbra:
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

Gotye:

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way

I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way

I beg and borrow and steal
Have foresight, and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that, I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you and this is crazy

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar

And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm tryin' hard to take it back

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now, I know that I'm not all that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight(na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight(na na na na na na)
Carry me home tonight(na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight(na na na na na na)

The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?

Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight

Maroon 5:
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be
It's even harder to picture that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it but is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow, 'cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine, I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before, but all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed, still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home

If happy ever after did exist

And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick, now I'm at a payphone

Wiz Khalifa:
Man, fuck that shit, I'll be out spending all this money
While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stunnin'

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top, or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for, Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

Wished I go away, got what you was looking for, now It's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

I had a way then, losing it all on my own
I had a heart then, but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Home

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over
With someone new
They told you I was moving on
Over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swingin'
You try to break me
But you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the brokenhearted
Thanks to you, I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

Being the way that you are is enough

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

You'll understand why I want you so desperately

So come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song

What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show

And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried

Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know(come on)

So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Well, this is it guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands

This one is not for the folks at home
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she call "love"
But when I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from

Some terrible nights
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree

It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
I'm wide awake
How did I read the stars so wrong?

I'm wide awake
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down

Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud 9
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet
I'm wide awake
Need nothing to complete myself, no

I'm wide awake
Yeah, I am born again
Outta the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down

Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete

Falling from cloud 9
(It was out of the blue, I'm) Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
(Yeah I'm letting you go, I'm) I'm falling from cloud 9

I'm wide awake
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling
I'm wide awake
I am trying to hold on

I'm wide awake
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side
(I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore
I'm wide awake

I'm wide awake

Yeah I'm falling from cloud 9
(It was out of the blue, I'm) Crashing from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight
(Yeah I'm letting you go, I'm) I'm falling from cloud 9

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the "How you been?"
And get down to the "more than friends" at last

Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya

Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed

How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?

I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, imma do it for the Bay

Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay."

Seven... grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt

It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit

I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga money talks, and Mr. Ed

I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers

I tongue kiss her other tongue

I'll take care of you... (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things, but
My mind didn't change it, I still feel the same, What's
A life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know

We know,
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still

So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste (aww)
Pushing me away so I give her space (Aww)
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break

I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl it just don't show

When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow...

You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do:
I'll take care of you...

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me,
To your friends, when they ask you,
Even though we both know that you do
You do

One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes

We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know

You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you... instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I won't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the Earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
Still looking up

I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

You know I'm not one to break promises
I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe
At the end of it all you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

Which way is right, which way is wrong
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're headed separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's oh so much that you deserve
Nothing to say, nothing to do
I've nothing to give, I must live without you

You know we're headed separate ways
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself

Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh woah

So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah
Except for me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me, no
Away from me
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me
No

Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say "I hate you," we break up, you call me, I love you

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh(yeah)
Ooh(yeah)
Ooh(yeah)
Oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say "Never say never..."

...So he calls me up, and he's like, "I still love you," and I'm like, I mean this is exhausting.
You know, like we are never getting back together. Like, ever.

No, we are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, ooh, getting back together
We, ooh, oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke

As long as you lo-lo-lo-...love me (love me)

Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova

Just take my hand

A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me, "Sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like, "Whoa" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke

Get inside it

Clenched shut jaw

Headache again tonight

Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been cryin', I've been cryin'
I've been dyin' over you

Tie a knot, in the rope
Tryin' to hold, tryin' to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I've finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss

You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning, so
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day

I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting
That we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say
When I say there is nothing left

No more sick, whiskey dick
No more battles from me
You'll be callin' a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep

I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancin' alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never plan that one day I'd be losing you

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one, without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one, the one, the one

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world

Kill the lights, shut 'em off, you're electric
Devil eyes tellin' me "Come and get it,"
I'll have you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

Girl, tonight you're the prey, I'm the hunter
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me whisperin' in your ear that I wanna
Take off all your clothes and put somethin' on ya

And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream yeah,
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night,
Get you going like a-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
A-ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby

I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm 'bout to explode

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running, 'cause you're taking me there
Don't you know... you spin me out of control?

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on!

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Booming like a bass drum
Sparking up a rhythm
Baby, come on!

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

You got me losing my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running, 'cause you're taking me there
Don't you know... you spin me out of control?

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right

I'm overseas at about a 100 G's a show
Don't test me boy (don't test me boy)
'Cause I rap with the best fo' sho'

Cremate my body, let the ocean have what's left of me

I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed

In Romania, she pulled me to the side and said, "Pit, you can have me and my sister."
In Lebanon, yeah the women da bomb
And in Greece, you guessed it, the women are sweet
Been all around the world but I ain't gon' lie there's nothing like Miami's heat.... dale!

In Colombia women got everything done,
But they're some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, they freaky with big ol' booties and they thongs, blue, yellow, and green!

En L.A., tengo la Mexicana, en New York tengo la boricua
Besito para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah!

Hold on to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave is stringing us along
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home

Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found

Can't erase so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night without you, without you

I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
Lost my heart, I lost my mind, without you, without you

Oh!
You're so sexy, yo!

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't know what city I'm in at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month

In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long,
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it

Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving

'Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
'Cause they be swallowing it

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We'll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Let's go

I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

Ha ha.

I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you

Like everything that's green, girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you want it too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted

Anyone can tell you you're pretty and
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight

When I wrap you up

When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
'Cause baby I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need

You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted

And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever

Never let you forget it

Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime

Well if you ain't a ten, you're a 9.9
Tippin' and spillin' that homemade wine on your tied-up, t-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild, throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God Al-mighty

So, let's slip on out, where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take off on out in the water

Chances are, if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again

She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time it's fine with me
Young ass an intern, with money like I built the shit
Streets talking that confirm

Go ask them who just catch it
Stay keeping my cup full so I'm extra charged like a state tax

Hey, boy, you never had much game
So I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away-way-way

Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this

And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

Boy, you can say anything you want
I don't give a shit, no one else can have ya
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Trying to rock them ugly jeans, jeans, jeans

You clearly didn't think this through
If what I've been told is true
You'll be crawling back like boo-hoo-hoo

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this

And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

Want-want u, want u back

I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

Ooh, I thought you'd still be mine
When I kissed you goodbye, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh, and you might be with her
But I still had you first, oh-oh, oh-oh

We used to be, but now there's a separation
Between you and me
Baby I'm moving on to another girl that understands me more
Dated her in front your place so you can see it all

I remember the times, when we used to bond
But I never realized that you wanted to be mine
So I gave her the ring, instead of you, nickname too
I can tell you're upset, because it ain't you

Met a new girl, and I gave her my heart
Not noticing that you wanted me from the very start
You want me back?
We can just be friends, don't try to sting all over again

Boy, you can say anything you want
I don't give a shit, no one else can have ya
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

I broke it off thinking you'd be crying
Now I feel like shit looking at you flying
I want u back, I want u back
Want-want u, want u back

Ooh, I want u back, I want u back

Drop that ass make it boomerang
Take my belt off bitch I'm Pootie Tang
Tippy tow tippy tay you gonna get a tip today
Fuck that you gonna get some dick today

I walk in with my crew and I'm breaking they necks

And it got a attitude no wonder why it's stuck up

To this day, when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip-flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
'I'm On Fire' and 'Born To Run'
You looked at me and I was done
And we, we're just gettin' started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Sang 'Ooh, ooh'

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin', "Don't go"

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old Jeep, I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
There'd still be a spark

From back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
'Bout your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear 'Born In The U.S.A'
Do you relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen?
Do you think about my old Jeep? Think about the stars in the sky?
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen, Springsteen

Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen
Whoa, Springsteen

Felt the jones in my bones when you were touchin' me, oh oh
Didn't want to take it slow

In a daze, going crazed, I can barely think
You're replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep, oh oh
Waiting for my phone to blow

Oh oh, yeah

Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yep, and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour

Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Come on, that's right

Honest, baby, I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Come on, that's right, cheerio

What's the time? Such a crime
Not a single word, sippin' on that Patron
Just to calm my nerves, oh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone

Oh yeah

Had me up, had me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, hold me up,
Baby I'm in doubt,
Oh oh, and I don't even think you know

No, no, no

Come on, that's right, cheerio, hey

Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you said it's like go with the view
Business in the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was that outfit really whack?

This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it
Cheerio

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight

Dreams, that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio

Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation
I know that much is understood

And I realize
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you

Damn, damn girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent

I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced

So until then
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

Not over you
Not over you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote

Make me your radio (yeah, a-ha)
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo
(Gym Class Heroes baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like get Rihanna, chicka, Travie, I can handle that

Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you
Heh heh heh

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)

Make me your radio (Uh huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo (Let's go)

If I was an old school fifty-pound boombox ('member them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop?

And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear this, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
O-oh

Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo

I only pray you'll never leave me behind
Because good music can be so hard to find
I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote

Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo

You're probably hoping it never would end
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand?

Let me see you get high and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

She like them boy with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old range
I knew her when I rock big old chains
Now the little nigga doing big old things

Would you look at that, I came back for her
Just to give it to you, like you asked for it
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for it
It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard

I told her, baby girl come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year, that's unfair but

So is life, take a chance, roll a dice
Money can't buy you love cause it's overpriced
Don't overthink just hope it's right
I'm only here for the night

Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if imma see you again, see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am

Every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar, listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter, she called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door flown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away, blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window till it's all blown away
(Blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
(Blown away)

Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left to yesterday
Every tear soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Wohh ho ho oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Wohh oh oh oh)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Wohh ho ho oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to

Run away, do we separate?
Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached the climax, climax

I've fallen somehow, feet off the ground
Love is the cloud, that keeps raining down
Where are you now when I need you around?
I'm on my knees but it seems we're

Going nowhere fast

It's too late we've reached the climax, climax

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made our mess, what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all, at all, at all, at all?

Won't commit so we choose to

Run away, do we separate?

You say, it's better if we love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now when I need you around?
I'm on my knees but it seems we're going

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to

Run away, do we separate?

Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say we're done the way you always do
It's easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they're gonna say
We're bad for each other, but we ain't good for anyone else

I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We don't have to miss each other, come over
We don't have to fix each other, come over
We don't have to say forever, come over
You don't have to stay forever, come over

I told you I wouldn't call, I told you I wouldn't care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We share, somethin' so charming, still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls

Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack

It's killing me, swear I never cried so much,
'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time, that I frowned the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down

Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around

Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much

'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts, 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave
But the love keeps us together
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to

That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack

And every time I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right

'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while while

Girl tell me how you feel
What your fantasy?
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up
Be my senorita

We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the wall's with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo

Private reservations, glasses full of merlot
A rose, a burgundy, travel like turbo
Brush up on your Espanol
We'll Barcelona bounce
So smile, and pack your bags real good baby

It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom

And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you were...

[T-Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it, cause you've been waiting on me since
I said that I was hitting the club

Somthing coming up on me,
and I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me texts
Like boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come home on time
She might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked
With one of my chains on

She might come and find me
And then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song

And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
"What is he doing?" oh "what is he doing?"

Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
And you texting me like imma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
Ooo oh my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin' and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing

Girl I got you, girl I got you

And you ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya,
Too many thirsty girls up in this club

For me to leave here with one of them that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
iPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah so by the time I'm at your crib

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
And you yawning
But I been drinking all night and I feel like performing
Wit you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser, don't want nothing less
'Cause I'm sure you're the best, you're the one

So I let you, that's how you show me love
And when we finished you like "Damn babe, you woke me up."
I love the way you put it down like it's for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing that's comin' up (ha ha ha ha ha)

Heart beats fast, colors and promises
How to be brave, how can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone, all of my doubt suddenly goes away
Somehow, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
Standing in front of me, every breath
Every hour has come to this, one step closer

I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more, one step closer, one step closer

Been goin' 'round and 'round all day
Bailin' some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town

Shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a little shiner bock
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio

Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost down in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that's a good night
Anyone from the Heartland is gonna understand
What I'm talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy,
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio

Put your pretty pink toes on the dash

So this is what you meant?
When you said that you were spent?
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a raincheck

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a raincheck

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin

I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song

I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

Gonna cuss the morning when it comes
Cause I know the rising sun
Ain't no good for me
Cause you'll have to leave

Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There's plenty of gas and the night's still alive

You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song

I'm set on cruise control

Of everything I got

To pay more attention to the things that I need.
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust,
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me?

I'm hard to love, hard to love,
I don't make it easy,
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love

You say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me.
Good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you.

Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted,
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.

And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me.
Good
Good

You love me good

Somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A no trespass sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
Somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

Somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate, on a summer night
Somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

And there's somethin' 'bout a girl, in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field, will make a boy a man
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

And there's somethin' 'bout a kiss, that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Beggin' for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

Somethin' 'bout a creek, around 2 a.m.
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 a.m.

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Beggin' for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

98@Jason Aldean@Fly Over States
@@@
Couple guys in first class on a flight from New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk, killin' time, flirtin' with the flight attendants
Thirty thousand feet above what would be Oklahoma

Just a bunch of square corn fields and wheat farms, man it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd wanna live down there, in the middle of nowhere

They've never drove through Indiana
Met the man who plowed that Earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made those fly over states

I bet that mile haul in Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flat bed cowboy stacking U.S. steel on a three day haul
Roads and rails under their feet, yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes

Like a watercolor painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made those fly over states

Take a ride across the Badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo

You'll understand why God made...
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those fly over states
Yeah

Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma
Take a ride

99@Eli Young Band@Even If It Breaks Your Heart

Way back on the radio dial,
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child.
Every note just wrapped around his soul,
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll.

Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'.
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."

Downtown is where I used to wander.
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside.
So I would stand out on the sidewalk,
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night.

Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'.
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."

Some dreams stay with you forever,
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were.
Some dreams keep on gettin' better,
Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure.

Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'.
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart."

Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.

Keep on dreamin'

100@Linkin Park@Burn It Down
@@@
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

The colours conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

(When you fall I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn)
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
(When you fall I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn)
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
