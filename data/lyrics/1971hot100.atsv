I tiptoe past the master bedroom where My mother reads her magazines. I hear her call sweet dreams, But I forgot how to dream.  But you say it's time we moved in together And raised a family of our own, you and me - Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be: You want to marry me, we'll marry.  My friends from college they're all married now; They have their houses and their lawns. They have their silent noons, Tearful nights, angry dawns. Their children hate them for the things they're not; They hate themselves for what they are- And yet they drink, they laugh, Close the wound, hide the scar.  But you say it's time we moved in together And raised a family of our own, you and me - Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be: You want to marry me, we'll marry.  You say that we can keep our love alive Babe - all I know is what I see - The couples cling and claw And drown in love's debris. You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds, But soon you'll cage me on your shelf - I'll never learn to be just me first By myself.  Well O.K., it's time we moved in together And raised a family of our own, you and me - Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be, You want to marry me, we'll marry, We'll marry.

92@Paul Stookey@Wedding Song (There Is Love)@He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts; Rest assured, this troubadour is acting on His part. The union of your spirits here has caused Him to remain, For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name there is love, there is love.  Well a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home; They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one; As it was in the beginning is now and 'til the end, Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again, and there is love, there is love.  Well then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife? Is it love that brings you here or love that brings you life? Or if loving is the answer, then who's the giving for? Do you believe in something that you've never seen before?  Oh there's love, oh there's love.  Oh the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain, For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name there is love, oh there's love.
