18@Tom Cochrane@Life Is A Highway@Love's like a road that you travel on When there's one day here and the next day gone Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There's a world outside every darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore We won't hesitate Break down the garden gate There's not much time left today  Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long  Through all these cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around I loved you now like I loved you then This is the road and these are the hills From Mozambique to those Memphis nights The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights Knock me down, back up again You're in my blood; I'm not a lonely man There's no load I can't hold Road so rough; this I know I'll be there when the light comes in Just tell 'em we're survivors  Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!) If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long  There was a distance between you and I A misunderstanding once But now we look it in the eye (oh!)  There ain't no load that I can't hold Road so rough, this I know I'll be there when the light comes in Just tell 'em we're survivors  Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!) Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!) Life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long If you're going my way I wanna drive it all night long (gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah!)
19@Michael Jackson@Remember The Time@Verse 1 Do you remember when we fell in love We were young and innocent then Do you remember how it all began It just seemed like heaven so why did it end Do you remember back in the fall We'd be together all day long Do you remember us holding hands In each other's eyes, we'd stare  Chorus Do you remember the time When we fell in love Do you remember the time When we first met Do you remember the time When we fell in love Do you remember the time  Verse 2 Do you remember how we used to talk, ya know We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn Do you remember all the things we said Like I love you so, I'll never let you go Do you remember back in the spring Every morning, birds would sing Do you remember those special times They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind  Chorus Do you remember the time When we fell in love Do you remember the time When we first met, girl Do you remember the time When we fell in love Do you remember the time  Hook Those sweet memories will always be dear to me And, girl, no matter what was said I will never forget what we had, now baby  Chorus Do you remember the time When we fell in love Do you remember the time When we first met Do you remember the time When we fell in love Do you remember the time  Do you remember the time When we fell in love Do you remember the time When we first met Do you remember the time When we fell in love Do you remember the time  Outro Remember the time, remember the time (do you remember girl) Remember the time (on the phone, you and me), remember the time (till dawn, two or three) (What about us, girl) remember the time (do you, do you, do you, do you, do you) Remember the time (In the park, on the beach) Remember the time, remember the time (you and me in Spain) (What about, what about) remember the time (Ooh, in the park) Remember the time (after dark, do you, do you, do you) Remember the time (do you, do you, do you, do you) Remember the time (yeah, yeah), remember the time

22@Patty Smyth@Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough@Now, I don't want to lose you But I don't want to use you Just to have somebody by my side And I don't want to hate you I don't want to take you But I don't want to be the one to cry  And that don't really matter To anyone anymore But like a fool I keep losing my place And I keep seeing you walk through that door  But there's a danger in loving somebody too much And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust There's a reason why people don't stay where they are Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough  Now, I could never change you I don't want to blame you Baby, you don't have to take the fall Yes, I may have hurt you But I did not desert you Maybe I just want to have it all  It makes a sound like thunder It makes me feel like rain And like a fool who will never see the truth I keep thinking something's gonna change  But there's a danger in loving somebody too much And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust There's a reason why people don't stay where they are Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough  And there's no way home When it's late at night and you're all alone Are there things that you wanted to say And do you feel me beside you in your bed There beside you where I used to lay  And there's a danger in loving somebody too much And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch There's a reason why people don't stay who they are Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough Baby, sometimes love, It just ain't enough

Often wonder what makes her work I guess I'll leave that question to the experts Assuming that there are some out there They're probably alone, solitaire  I can remember when I caught up With a past-time intimate friend, she said "Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely But you probably don't think nothin' of me."  She was right, though, I can't lie She's just one of those corners in my mind And I just put her right back with the rest That's the way it goes, I guess  Baby you send me Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you Baby you send me Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you  Careless whisper from a careless man A neutron dance for a neutron fan Marionette strings are dangerous things I thought of all the trouble they bring  An eye for an eye, a spy for spy Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh Tell me that she's not dreaming She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning  Reality used to be a friend of mine Caused complete control, I don't take too kind Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on Guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone  She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign I told her whispers in my heart were fine What did she think she could do I feel for her, I really do  And I stared at the ring finger on her hand I wanted her to be a big P.M. Dawn fan But I had to put her right back with the rest That's the way it goes, I guess  Baby you send me Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you Baby you send me Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you  Baby you send me Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you Baby you send me Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you  Baby you send me Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you Baby you send me Baby you send me Set adrift on memory bliss of you
