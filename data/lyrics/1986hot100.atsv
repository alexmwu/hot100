Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand, someone who understands
And when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say "I'll show you"

Say you, say me
Say it for always, oh
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believe in who you are
You are a shining star

Say you, say me
Say it for always, aw
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

Say it together

VERSE ONE
Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you
then I realized
that it was just my mind
playing tricks on me....

It seems colder lately at night
and I try to sleep with the lights on
Everytime the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe (just can't believe)
That we're through...

CHORUS
I miss you (I miss you...)
Theres no other way to say it
And I,  And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me........

VERSE TWO
Is it done and over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?
But it's our first love...
all the feelings that we used to share...
I refuse to believe that you don't care.

CHORUS
I miss you (I miss you...)
Theres no other way to say it
And I,And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me........

BRIDGE
I've got to gather my senses together (Gather)
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now (over now)
be strong (be strong)
I can't believe that you're gone...
I've got to carry on.

CHORUS
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's driving me crazy
I don't want to live without you.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me............

Why we can't just hold on to each others' hands
This time might be the last, I fear
Unless I make it all too clear
I need you so, ohh

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right, mmm
Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
I need you so

Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash, venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes

Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West, or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

In the burning heart, just about to burst
There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night, rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire

In the warriors code, there's no surrender
Though his body says stop, his spirit cries never
Deep in our soul a quiet ember
Knows it's you against you
it's the  Paradox that drives us on

It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack, it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

In the burning heart, just about to burst
There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night, rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire

The wind blows hard against this mountainside
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road

My heart is old, it holds my memories
My body burns a gem-like flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

Kyrie, eleison
Through the darkness of the night

Kyrie, eleison
Where I'm going, will you follow?

Of what my life would mean to me
Would I have followed down my chosen road
Or only wished what I could be

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of all

And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love

Both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meetin' up together
'Cause as soon as I look at you it will show on my face, yeah

I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight, yeah
Livin' two lives just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on in there or fall

Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
Tryin' so hard to hide the way we feel

But we can't let go
'Cause what we feel is, oh, so real
So real, so real

You and me, are we fair
Is this cruel or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret loves all of the time

We gotta be careful so that no one will know

There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head

In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West End town

In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead-end world

Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what
How much have you got?

Have you got it, do you get it
If so, how often?
And which do you choose
A hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)

Just you wait till I get you home

When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory?
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

I often wonder how it could be you loving me
Two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me

Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I would wait for

Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Falling behind in what could be

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

Bring it, oh

I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone

Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to neither sooner or later

Holding back the years
Chance for me to escape from all I know
Holding back the tears
'Cause nothing here has grown

I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could, yeah

I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on

So tired

Wasted all those years

On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones

Turning and returning
To some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say

My love
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn my way and say

Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees

White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand(shadows where I stand)
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands

I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this(all I remember)
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away(further I'm away)

Is it cloak and dagger
Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall

(Weaker in my eyesight)Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip(words that have no form)
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away(further I'm away)

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth

In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss(prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
(Every single second)Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then, it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you - can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I'd run away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide?
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned

How - how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part
Of life's imperfections born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time
That told the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
Don't want to be without you
Baby tonight

Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat.
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet.
It's the rhythm of the island
And like sugarcane, so sweet.
If you want to do the conga
You've got to listen to the beat.

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Feel the fire of desire
As you dance the night away.
'Cos tonight we're gonna party
Till we see the break of day.
Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you got.
Once the music hit your system
There's no way you're gonna stop.

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it,
Do the conga
Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it

You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize
It's hard to take courage

In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember when
I last saw you laughing

If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You can call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
And don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors

Metal under tension
Begging you to touch and go

Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone

Heading into twilight
Spreading out her wings tonight
She got you jumping off the deck
And shoving into overdrive

Highway to the danger zone
I'll take you right into the danger zone

They'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Oh, yeah!

Out along the edges
Is always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Gonna take you right into the danger zone

Mmm hmm.
Well, what's up with this guy? Do you really like him that much?
Yes, honey, I love him. He is fine, he does a lot of nice things for me.
I know he used to do nice stuff for you, but what has he done for you lately?

Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind...
Who's right?

What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

Used to go to dinner almost every night
Danced until I thought I'd lose my breath
Now it seems your dancin' feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death...
Ain't that a shame?

I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth
I'm tellin' you... no way.

You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always puttin' off what we could do today
Soap opera says you've got one life to live
Who's right who's wrong?

What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately

You can look at the menu but you just can't eat

You can dip your foot in the pool but you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment but you can't commit the sin

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can build a mansion but you just can't live in
You're the fastest runner but you're not allowed to win
Some break the rules and live to count the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can see the summit but you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain

We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you

Your temperamental moody side,
the one you always try to hide from me.

But I know when you have something on your mind.
You've been trying to tell me for the longest time.
And before you break my heart in two,
There's something I've been trying to say to you.

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes,
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry,
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say "I love you"
But the words got in the way

Your heart has always been an open door
But baby I don't even know you anymore.
And despite the fact it's hurting me,
I know the time has come to set you free.

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say

These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday(oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day(oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day(oh)
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time

'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday(oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day(oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day(oh)

Of all of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down

He tells me in his bedroom voice
"C'mon honey, let's go make some noise."
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
A quick hit, that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain
Night is young, so are we
Let's get to know each other better, slow and easily
Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake your body to the music, maybe then you'll score

So come on, baby, won't you show some class?
Why you want to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off (Mmm...)
To have a good time, oh no
We could dance and party all night
(All night, we could dance all night)
And drink some cherry wine, uh-huh
We don't have to take our clothes off (No, no, no)

Gimme conversations, good vibrations, through and through

Come around and talk it over
So many things that I want to say
You know I like my girls a little bit older

Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover
I just wanna use your love tonight, whoa

Try to stop my hands from shakin'
'Cause somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we were all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'

As you're leaving, please, would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong
Another shoulder to cry upon

I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

I took a day job amendment, I took a liking to you
I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You wanna message a confession, you wanna martyr me too
You wanna margin of error for two

Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer, an exception, I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book but I knew

In times of tenderness in terms baby so true
Until such time as I can understand all the things you do

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification

Want to forgive you for all the things that you do
Wanna forget how to remember with you

'Cause there'll be starlight all night
When we're close together
Share those feelings dancin' in your eyes tonight
They're guiding us
Shinin' till the mornin' light

Shine sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I wanna be
Oh sweet freedom carry me along

Hey!
What?
Listen

I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
Till you walked through my door

I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me baby this I know, 'cause it's

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh so many times
Those teardrops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you

No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's

True, so if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye

How do rumors get started, they're started by the jealous people and
They get mad seein' somethin' they had and somebody else is holdin'
They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
These wicked women, ooh, they just persist
Maybe you think it's cute, but girl, I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business please don't mess

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now about me and the girl next door

Hear the one about Tina, some say she's much too loose
That came straight from a guy who claims he's tastin' her juice
Hear the one about Michael, some say he must be gay
I try to argue, but they said if he was straight he wouldn't move that way
Hear the one about Susan, some say she's just a tease
In a camisole she's six feet tall, she'll knock you to your knees

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day

I can't go no place without somebody pointin' a finger
I can't show my face 'cause when it comes to rumors I'm a dead ringer
It seems from rumors I just can't get away
I bet there'll even be rumors floatin' around on Judgment Day
I'll think I'll write my congressman and tell him to pass a bill
For the next time they catch somebody startin' rumors, shoot to kill

Look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now about me and the girl next door

What's mine is mine, I ain't got time for rumors in my life
I'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks, so please let me live my life

And the children drunk lemonade
And the morning lasted all day, all day
And through an open window came
Like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away, oh

Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya
Ah hey ma ma ma hey-y-yah
Life in a northern town
Ah hey ma ma ma ma

They sat on the stoney ground
And he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down to listen
He said in winter 1963
It felt like the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy
And The Beatles

Yeah, yeah

The evening turned to rain
Watched the water roll down the drain
As we followed him down to the station
And though he never would wave goodbye
You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight...bye-bye

Ah hey ma ma mommy doo-din-nie-ya

And find somewhere to hide
Can't I knock down your door
And drag myself inside
I'll light your candles, baby
And maybe I'll light your life

I wanna feel the breathless end
You come to every night
This ever changing love
Is pushing me too far
I feel the need to reach you
Right now wherever you are

These empty arms are getting stronger
Every day, believe me, baby

We cannot live together
We cannot live apart
And that's the situation
We've known it from the start

Everytime that I look at you
I can see the future
'Cause you know I know, baby
That I don't wanna go

Just throwing it all away

Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind?

I watch the world go 'round and 'round
And see mine turnin' upside down

Throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)

Now who will light up your darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
'Cause you know I know, baby
That I don't wanna go

Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Hey

Opening eyes impale neon flickers
She moon, she turning away
The city's her slave but he's cheating his mistress

She's moody and grey
She's mean and she's restless
So restless, so restless indeed

All over you as they say
Rumours or rivals yell at the strike force
Hi guys, by the way
Are you aware you're being illegal?

It's making your savior behaviour look evil
'Scuse my timing but say
How'd you fit in with this flim, flam and judy

Maximum big surprise
Your smile is something new

I pull my shirt off and pray
We're sacred and bound to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day

Stretching my love down the way
To your invitation stretching my body
Use your intuitive play
'Cause maybe we have more play time than money

Maximum big surprise
She knows something new

I pull my shirt off and pray
I'm saving myself to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray
We're coming up on re-election day

By roads and backways a lover's chance down wind
Cut open murmurs and sounds be calm hands on skin
Carry further, entangled strands all sing
I'm saving some time to slip away
We could dance!

Shouldn't be asking, wild and scheming
Could be my election day

With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

Counting ten tin soldiers in a row

When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night?

And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

With the boys in school
And her feet was flyin' up in the air
Singing hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
I was swingin' like I just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
Cause she knew what was she was doin'

Anxiety had taken hold
My body quivered, hot flashes ignited in me, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Gazing deep into my eyes
You spoke these words, I was hypnotized
Let me share a night in your fantasy, ooh, ooh

Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams
"Please make love to me"

You're the object of my desire
Baby, ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on

You're the object (Sugar) of my desire (Yeah)
Oh, baby, ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on

When I go to sleep at night
Visions of you here by my side
Fireworks explode deep inside of me, ay-yi-yi-yi
I pinch myself as you're lyin' there
We kiss each other, now I'm really scared
Too much to ask even for a fantasy, oh, oh, oh

Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams
"Please make love to me"

'Cause you're the object of my desire (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on

You're the object of my desire
Won't you ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey, you really turn me on and on and on and on

You're the object (I've got to have your love)
(I need your love)
Object (Wanna be the one, baby)
Hey, you really turn me on

You're the object (Love so fine)
Baby (I wanna know), would you be mine
Object
Hey, you really turn me on and on and on and on

Object
Object
Hey, you really turn me on

I saw you standing and I felt your rage
Like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl, I know what to believe

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up, ooh
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up

In your dream, it's overcast
Rain comes down, moving your way fast
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

You turn a corner and you see a door
Walk on through, throw yourself on the floor
Oh, when you're looking up, it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with movie star eyes

You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
And I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up, ooh
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up, shape up
You're living on dreamtime (you want to run away)
Whoa-whoa
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
Want to run away, want to run away

I know
I say

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
Shape up
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up

I never saw anybody fall apart so fast
You're living in dreamtime you know it ain't gonna last
Never saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong
Living in dreamtime, it's hard to carry on, girl

I know you well
And I can tell
Something's on your mind

'Cause in your dreams
The demon screams
I know he's going to hurt you blind

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all
We need to get us through

And diamond rings
And all those things
They never sparkle
Like your smile

And as for fame
It's just a name
That only satisfies
You for awhile

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all
We need to get us through

I've heard it said
Or maybe read
Only money makes
The world go round

But all the gold
Won't heal your soul
If your world should
Tumble to the ground

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

So listen
Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah

Love is all
Love is all
Love is all we need, yeah

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is
All we need to get us through

If I was King for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was King for just one day
Just one thing to say
Love

Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do

Here we stand
Trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all

Do you really want to know
Just how long will last
Will all of the bad times pass?
How can we make things right?

Ooh and why
Why is the world so unkind?
We surely can find peace of mind
If we only see the light

Can't we see that
Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do

Whoa, here we stand
Trying not to fall
Oh, there's no need to worry
Love will conquer all

Can somebody tell me why?
Why do our dreams go wrong?
Why can't we all belong?
Ooh, where did we start?

Oh, and tell me when
When will we ever learn
There's nowhere else we can turn
The truth is in our hearts

Here we are together
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Sometimes the road
Gets hard to travel
Sometimes the pain's
Too much to bear

Sometimes when life
Seems to unravel
That's the time, oh, to say
We're gonna make it anyway

Can't we see that
Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all, is all that we can do

Here we stand
Trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all

I'd say love was a magical flame
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there

I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare

'Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared

Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care

I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care

No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love

And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear

Some people live their dreams
Some people close their eyes
Some people's destiny
Passes by

There are no guarantees
There are no alibis
That's how our love must be
Don't ask why

It takes some time
God knows how long
I know that I can forget you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same

There were the nights
Holding you close
Someday I'll try to forget them

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I'll be over you

(Instrumental solo)

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart stops breakin'
Anticipating
Someday I'll be over you

As soon as my heart...
(As soon as my heart stops breakin')
(Anticipating)

Her parents said, girl don't leave home
But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so who'll pay your fare
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word, my final word

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home
She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home
Go home baby, you better go home right now
Go home, little girl you better go home
