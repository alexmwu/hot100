[Spoken]
Wish I told her how I felt..
Maybe she'd be here right now.
But instead...

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say the things I needed to say?
How could I let my angel get away?
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly, but you're nowhere around

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside
And nobody knows it but me

I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get?
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know, I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me

Said when the nights are lonely...

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Wasting my precious energy

Little Boo, but God's got him and I'm gonna miss everybody
I only rolled and blows my gauge looked at him while he lay
When playing with destiny, plays too deep for people to say
Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease well then please
Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me

Layzie
God bless you working on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, God is who we praise
Even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge
And I betcha my soul won't budge
Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs
Ooh what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll
Can I get a witness let it unfold
We livin our lives till eternal our soul aye-oh-aye-oh

Exactly how many days we got lasting
While you laughing we're passing, passing away
So y'all go rest y'all souls
'Cause I know I'ma meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs baby

Wi$h
Lil Eazy's long gone
Really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go bye bye
All a lil thug could do is cry, cry
Why they kill my dog and man
I miss my uncle Charles y'all
And he shouldn't be gone, in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong
Ooh so wrong, ooh so wrong
Gotta hold on gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on (lean on)

Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air (Summer night, summer night)
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say, say it again

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
Say, say it again

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever

And past your door
But you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead
Of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run

I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain

Back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hanging around your old address?

And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on

And I miss you -
Like the deserts miss the rain

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
I guess you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there

And who would've thought? It figures

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye-aye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down, he thought, "Well, isn't this nice?"
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day

When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A "No Smoking" sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife, hmph

A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid

Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' bout you

Be sittin' up in my room

Verse 2:
Pray that you'll invest in my happiness
All it takes is just one simple word from you
Turn my heart around,if I'm making ground
Pretty baby please,tell me if I'm getting through
Tell me what is up
You see I need to know
Tell me if I'm far or,if I'm getting close
I have but one concern,and that one concern is you

Baby, if I could, change the world

If I could be king, even for a day

I've been watchin' you from afar,
for as long as I can remember.
You're all a real man can need,
and ever asked for
This is love girl.
This is more than a crush, yeah.

It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw ya witcha man
smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the Coupe with my hat turned back
we caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
so i skated off, as you strolled off
looking at the legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If this love is real, he's got to handle competition
you only knew him 5 months (that's right)
besides he drink too much, and smoke too many blunts
and I be working out everyday thinking bout you
looking at my own eyes in the rear view
catchin flash backs of our eye contact
wish i could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
i would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years, hey lover

hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)

I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
and i don't wanna violate your relationship
so i lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
still he can't stop me from having day dreams
tounging you down with, huh, vanilla ice cream
kissing on your thighs under the moonlight
searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
we would walk down the isle of destiny
what your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
that seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
but there's a deeper level if you'd follow I'll lead
Hey lover

hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)

Last week I saw ya at the mall
standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
we talked about traveling the distant lands
escaping all the madness out here in the world
becomin my wife no longer my girl
then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
i kissed you softly and you yearned for more
we experienced pleasure unparallel
into an ocean of love we both fell
swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
fantasies interchanging with each kiss
undying passion unites our souls
together we swim until the point of no control
but it's a fantasy it won't come true
we never even spoke and your man swear he love you
so I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
keep my dreams alive until the right time

hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)

Keep your chickenhead, I'm lookin for a dime (word up)
Get my swerve on, make it hot, word bond
I'm lickin' on your ankle bracelet
We'll be sippin' Moet with strawberries to chase it
I'm nasty, ask me, why I lick my lips
So in the darkness, I can run my tongue over your tits
It's all good sugary, you ain't leavin'
Sit up on my face and help my stash grow even
Whipped cream taste mean from the back
She bounce with LL, now shorty's on the map
I put away the gat, took off the hat
Throw ya Mo's in the air if you like it like that
No doubt, boo, I keep it real, girl
Mad pleasure, blowin' up your whole world
Whatever's clever I got endless cash
Trees from Hawaii, two pulls and pass

I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey hey
I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey hey

Uhh, my scenario is grand (word up)
A dime piece, Henessey up in my hand
I "Turn Out the Lights" like Teddy (click)
I'm fiendin', starin' in the darkness, now I'm ready
Uh, ooh yeah, up in ya
Let it flow while I pump slow
Then I speed it up, heat it up
Make it mo' tasty, so you can swing low and lace me
Use your imagination
You do me, I'll do you, sex education
It's all good, it's cranberry Absolut and peach scnapps
Feelin' tipsy, loungin' on the rooftops
I'm 'bout to spank you on that ass (ooh)
I know you love it when it lasts (true)
When you need it, who you ask? (You)
What you sayin' when I dash? (Don't go, boo)

I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey hey
I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey hey

C'mon, you got to bounce with me, sugar, (you got to bounce) word up
You got to bounce with me, sugar, (word-a-word-a-word up) word up
You got to bounce with me, sugar, (you got to bounce with me, sugar)
Word up, you got to bounce with me, sugar (a-word-a-word-a-word up)

Warm it up, sugar, make it hot
Shorties'll swarm, make me wanna bust shots (Bo)
We speak daily on the regular
Run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand
Suntan oil, pina colada in you hand
Layin' up at night, peepin' out stars
Remember when we was at the club at the bar?
I told ya my status was that of a don
You thought I was a dog and you ain't wanna get it on
But my mind has attractin' qualities
On the emotions of a young lady (word up)
So here you are, smack dab up in the mix (uh-huh)
Shorty, this here's about as good as it gets
Word up, I'ma treat you like a queen from the heart
Crack the bubbly, and let the episode start

I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey hey
I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey hey

How do you cool your lips, after a summer's kiss?
How do you rid the sweat, after the body bliss?
How do you turn your eyes, from the romantic glare?
How do you block the sound of a voice
You'd know anywhere?

Oh, I really should've known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual goodbyes
By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face that told me
Maybe you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive
Insensitive
Insensitive

How do you numb your skin, after the warmest touch?
How do you slow your blood, after the body rush?
How do you free your soul, after you've found a friend?
How do you teach your heart it's a crime to fall in love again?

Oh, you probably won't remember me
It's probably ancient history
I'm one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you
I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch
I fell too fast, I feel too much
I thought that you might have some advice to give
On how to be insensitive

Oh, I really should've known

And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Got tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame

But if you could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

We grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
Reruns all become our history

A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
I won't tell 'em your name

Mmm, mmm
I won't tell 'em your name
Ow

Mmmmmm

I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are; come back down
And I won't tell 'em your name

People living their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
She says "Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls"

Says come here boys, there's nothing for free
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put him in your will, but...

Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers?
Who will save your soul after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
La da de da de da la da da

We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower went up
Where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin but...

Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers?
Who will save your soul after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
La da de da de da la da da

Some are walkin, some are talkin, some are stalkin their kill
You got social security, but that don't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil, but you're okay for today say
That you love them, take their money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

Who will save... save your soul when it comes to the babies now?
oh, who will save your soul, after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save... save your soul if you won't save your own?

You leave without a word, no message, no number
And now my head is pounding like rolling thunder
You left me with a heartache deep inside
Girl you should see me cry all night, and I wonder

Everybody says, what a shame, what is wrong
They don't like the game we play
Heard you're hanging round every night until dawn
I'm waiting for you night and day

Where do you go, my lovely
Where do you go
I wanna know, my lovely, I wanna know

Where do you go, oh oh eh oh
I wanna know, oh oh eh oh
Where do you go, oh oh eh oh...

You gotta break the silence, don't keep me waiting
Just like a river flowing to the sea
You are running back to me
Come back and save me

Where do you go, My Lovely

Come back and dry the tears, I cried for you baby
You've gotta stop this heartache deep inside
You've gotta help me make it through the night safely
Come back and save me

Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone and feeling down and out baby
When I never meant for this to end, it was so so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby, bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Though I must admit that things got out of hand
When you told me that he was just a friend
I should of had my trust in you from the very start darlin'
'Cause I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
Oh sometimes a man can say things that he really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby - bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Baby can we meet somewhere and talk about it
Oh baby, can we work it out
I'm not gonna let you go my baby before I let you know that I

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe

Must've been mid afternoon
I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and
He walked with a purpose
In his sneakers, down the street
He had many questions
Like children often do
He said:

Tell me all your thoughts on God
Tell me am I very far

Must've been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars
Skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions
Like children often do
We said:

Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'd really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'm on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far,
Am I very far now?

It's getting cold, picked up the pace!
How our shoes make hard noises in this place!
Our clothes are stained
We pass many cross-eyed people
And ask many questions
Like children often do

Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'd really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
'Cause I'm on my way to see her
So tell me, am I very far?
We're not very far now
We're not very far now (Tell me all your thoughts on God)
We're not very far now

So one of these nights and about twelve o'clock
This old world's going to reel and rock
Saints will tremble and cry for pain
For the Lord's gonna come in his heavenly airplane

If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to his face,
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home?

If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the saints
And all the prophets? And...

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home?

He's tryin' to make His way home
Back up to Heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone

Eleven years out of my life

Wasted my years, a fool of a wife

Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice

Swallowed my fears - stood by your side

Through sickness and health
'Til death do us part

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talking and where ya walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

I really hate to trip but I gotta loc'
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kind of G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasing dreams

I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool

Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living my life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is going, I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
What's going on in the kitchen? But I don't know what's cookin'

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

You're the one for me
You can call on me
It's all I want us to be
You're the one for me

I know that you're somebody else's guy
but these feelings I have for you I can't deny
She doesn't treat you the way you want her to
so come on stop frontin' I want to get with you

What you're girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further

You're the 1 (You're the 1 for me)
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (It's all I want us to be)
'cause you're the one (You're the one for me)

This can be an undercover romance
'cause I feel that I'm the type of girl
you should give a chance.
Taste and see how good it can be 'cause

What you're girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further

You're the 1 (You're the 1 for me)

So what's my chance I'm willing to do
anything to get in your pants
You don't have to worry I won't say a thing
and if she finds out I don't know nothing

You're the 1 (You're the 1 for me)
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (It's all I want us to be)

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

I wanna get into motion, a better devotion
So I can make it through the night
So the music is playin', you know what I'm saying
Now everything will be alright

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night
Ola ola e, ola ola e

Rhythm is a creation, a better sensation
That will lead you through the night
When your body is movin', the music is groovin'
I want to take you home tonight

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night
Ola ola e, ola ola e

Keep dancin' hard
Give this groove more feeling
Dance trance dance more dealing
In out up down all around
On the dance floor gettin' down
Take time just to show them who
We can make your body move
Totally, yes the party's started
Sweet dreams keep comin' harder

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

We've got nothin' in common

And we're falling apart

You'll say
The world has come between us

Still I know you just don't care

She said, "I think I remember the film.
And as I recall, I think we both kinda liked it."

I see you
The only one who knew me
But now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong

This is some of the lingua franca of the funk business,
And people come from miles around
With an almost religious devotion
To get on down.

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

What up everybody so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention
Now I wants to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know
1, 2, 3, it's like A-B-C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

If you got beef, then nigga eat a porkchop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I brake like antilocks, panties drop,
From hood to hood, block to block
Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right,
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night
My name ain't Wonder, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a Jheri curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on, now whatcha gonna do, so
Grab your partner, do-si-do,
If you don't know who it is, it's Coolio,
Slide, slide, but that's the past,
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

Push, push, in the bush
But don't step on no toes 'cause you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip 'cause I don't want to have to get 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy,
The way you shake that ass, it always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give a nigga his props
I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass.

1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

Has our conscience shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on

I drink myself a new found pity
Sittin' alone in New York City
And I don't know why

Are we listening
To hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering

All the words that I've been reading
Have started the act of bleeding
Into one
Into one

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
As the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh, it's the world I know

I drink myself a new found pity
Sittin' alone in New York City

Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I could hold you tight
Pain in my heart
Because I'm all alone
Why did you leave
Why did your love have to go
When I would do anything for you, I would
Thinking of ways
That I can win your heart

Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I, should meet

Junebug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess
Forgotten and absorbed to the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues down to see that

We don't even care, as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured

To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see

That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess
Forgotten and absorbed to the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see, there's no one around

I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there
So was I
In the park, 4th of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chili came to relay that you had a thang for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off
Lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am...

*Chorus* Repeat 2x
Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby bay-ooo-baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

I was like deep in a cool
Whatn't gonn' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly coversations
Had no time for new relation-
Ships
I must admit to you
When I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
This time you have turned me on
Lights off
Lights on
I guess the groove is on, and I am...

*Chorus*

Oh, why do I feel the way I do?
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin
On you
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line
That made me fall for you?
Do you know...
Why I'm diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
On you?

Diggin' the scene
It's on like that
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
On you

And I am...

Like a wave crashing into the shore
You wash away my dreams
Time, why you walk away?
Like a friend with somewhere to go
You left me crying

Can you teach me about tomorrow
And all the pain and sorrow, running free?
'Cause tomorrow's just another day
And I don't believe in time

Time, I don't understand
Children killing in the street
Dying for the color of a rag
Time, take their red and blue
Wash them in the ocean, make them clean
Maybe their mothers won't cry tonight

Like a tree growin' all alone

Time, the past has come and gone
The future's far away
Well, now only lasts for one second, one second

Last night you were so in to it
You told me secrets that
You've never told a soul
You were so nervous and
yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine
As you taste mine
I kissed your lips
You felt my body slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cuz it was so beautiful

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and
So very innocent
We talked of memories
Our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night
Right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight
In your soul
You felt incredible
I started to explore
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Sunlight, red red roses
The scent of you, it calms the heart
The sight of you, I fall apart
Moonlight, the things we notice
When we're in love, that's when it comes
And I'm so i'm so in love

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

Last night
I was inside of you
Last night
While making love to you
I saw the sun, the moon
The mountains and the rivers
I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

There are pieces here
I don't know where they go
I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips
I bet you feel a little crazy, but for me
We'll be famous on TV

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it

I jump on you, you jump on me
You push me out and even though you know I love you
I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth

When I kiss your salty lips
You will feel a little crazy, but for me

Take your love and throw it wide?

But could you really blame me?

All the pieces there will fit to make you whole

All the beauty and wonder
Wrapping around me

Dreaming of you
Oh I could not imagine
This dream coming true

So much joy now
In all that I touched
You make me feel
Everything so much

CHORUS:
I will love you for the earth at my feet
I will love you for the sun in the sky
I will love you for the falling rain,
I will love you for the heart that could break,
I will love you for the dreams that we share,
I will love you for the falling rain.

Facing the wind
Tears from my eyes
Baby, where have you been
When I was hoping
Was waiting for you
To pull back the door
To take me by the hand
And lead me through

This whole world was
A stranger to me
Now you have opened
My heart to everything

CHORUS

(Spoken)
Like a whisper in a dream
You've walked softly into my life
With love and sweet emotion
And as I gaze into your eyes
I see the beauty that God has created
And I love you girl
Now and forever

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now

Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me

I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise
Ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you
chorus
Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you
Cause you blow my mind
I promise boy that I'll be true
You're the perfect find so
Tell me if you want me to
If you thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't miss, no, no
Boy, you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
Cause you got more appeal
Than any man in this whole world
And baby
I got to know how you feel
chorus
Sweetheart
Now it's time to let you know
I don't wanna rush
We should take it slow
Boy, I can love you
Can you help me grow
Give me a new beginning
I'll give you a happy ending

Verse One: Andre

One for the money yes uhh two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin ta find that hookup
Now everyday we look up at the ceiling
Watchin ceiling fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin

We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryin ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, known that we could rock
Doin the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin the crowd move but we not makin no G's
And that's a no no

Verse Two: Big Boi

Yeah, uhh, check it
Ahh one two, ahh one two doe, niggaz
in the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin
Niggaz say motherfuck that playin, they payin
We stay in layin vo-cals, locals done made it with them big boys
up in dis industry, Outkast yea dem niggaz they makin big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggaz they take it lightly
Ninety-six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
...around this bitch

Chorus: repeat 2X

Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin down the strip on vogues
Comin up slammin Cadillac doz (doors)

Verse Three: Big Boi

Back in the day when I was younger, hunger
Lookin to fill me belly with that Rally's, bullshit, pull shit
off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was, stoned like white boys
Smokin them white golds before them blunts got krunk, chunky asses
passes gettin thrown like Hail Mary's and they lookin like Halle Berry
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sippin wine
We's just chillin, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smokin freely, me Lil B, Greet, Mon and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
where I live at, them rats know, mama I want to sing but
Mama I want to trick, and mama I'm suckin dick, now
We movin on up in da world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like eighty-two
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone
Like this Eastpointe and we gone

Chorus

Verse Four: Andre

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way
that I just came from, some nigga was sayin somethin
talkin bout "Hey man, you remember me from school?" smoke some
Naw not really but he kept smilin like a clown
facial expression lookin silly
And he kept askin me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been goin through tha same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
to the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
from Virginia, this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue

It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job then it's your resolve that breaks

Because the hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely

There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue I refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow

Was that the hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely

Suck it in, suck it in, suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin to see what you're doing to me
This MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
So desperately I sing to thee
Of love
Sure but also of rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried, well, no in fact I lied
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide
I'll do as I'll decide and let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute ditties
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all of your cities to the ground
I've found
I will not mess around
Unless I play then hey
I will go on all day. Hear what I say
I have a prayer to pray
That's really all this was
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
I don't rely on luck because

The hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The hook
On that you can rely

LL Cool J: It's our first time together and I'm feeling kinda horny.
Conventional methods of making love kinda bore me.
I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off,
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft.

LeShaun: I'm gonna call you big daddy and scream your name.
Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain.

J: So watcha sayin', I get my swerve on, bring it live,
Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight.

L: Mmm... Daddy slow down your flow.
Put it on me like a G baby nice and slow.
I need a rough neck nigga mandingo in a sec,
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back.

J: No doubt, I'm the player that you're talkin' about.

L: Mmm...But do you really think that you can work it out?

J: I guarantee you shorty it's real, baby stick it out,
Here comes the man of steel.

L: Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well,
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well,
Doin' it and doin' it and doin' it well,
J: I represent Queens, she was raised out in Brooklyn.

I'm in the mix now, searching for the right spot,
To hit now, get down,

L: Damn my lover dig down
You use a rubber?

J: Damn right.

L: You are my lover?

J: All night.

L: The putty good to you? Word to motha?

J: Man tight.
The only thing left to do is climax,
Let's make it last,

L: Word we ain't goin' out like that.
All this time you've been telling me that you was a Don.

J: I tried to warn you girl you wouldn't listen,
Now let's get it on.

L: Mmm make me wild.. don't do that.
Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back.

J: You talk good one shorty love you're makin' me sweat,
How a live nigga like it girl?

L: Nice and wet.
We get it on to the break of dawn, damn your large,
How a big girl like it daddy?

J: Nice and hard.
Safe sexin' it, flexin' it, gettin' mad affectionate,
Chewin' it, doin' it, all while we're doin' it.

Chorus X2

J: Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way.

L: Make it hot.

J: Scheming on the ass since the first day.

L: Don't stop.
Damn I love it when you talk like that.
Make it bounce sugar,

J: Long as you can bounce me back.
More flesh than the greek fest,

L: Roll up the sess.

J: Pass the Hennessee,

L: Put my body to the test.
Way way back many niggas ago,
I was a young girl listening to how you flow.
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown.
From the back, from the side,

J: Right, I'm in the zone.
One of a kind when it's time to do mine.
Camcorder and the whole shit,

L: Press rewind.
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L.
Layin' back in the cut while we're under the spell.

J: Word life, I like the way the ep went down.
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown.
We'll be,

Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Well, baby can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even want to waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fastlove is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh... yeah, yeah

Hey, baby
Oh, yeah

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
They're all having babies
But I just want to have some fun

I won't bore you with the details, baby
Gonna get there in your own sweet time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right

Ooh... yeah, yeah

Yeah, what's there to think about, baby?
Get yourself some lessons in love

So close
I can taste it now, baby
So close

In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me
But I see lovin' in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh, yeah
I miss my baby
Tonight
So why don't we make a little room in my BMW, babe?
Searching for some peace of mind
Hey, I'll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion
Hoh, you really ought to get up now
That's right
Hoh, you really ought to get up

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Still slackin back-packin up my turf
Cause after me was a factor real worse at the worst
Stompin, jumpin wanna-be's
But ever however there's only one M A C (say what)

Ways of gettin richer, mister quick to hit your sister
I'm ballin in the Green County on chrome
I slip brothers on the deck on my cellular phone
I'm just loungin, leather, sound all around
And a dip on the other end wanna put me down now
No hesitation I hops to it
See it ain't easy bein' a Mac but somebody gotta do it
True it's, usually not represented right

And it will be tomorrow before she comes back home
Ding-dong it's on, nigga say no more
I'm with a truck full of women so just open the door
Cause yo, we came here to party
Get it crunk, get drunk and leave your house with somebody
True that, so homies don't bring your main misses
Cause it's real deal mackin when it comes to the Chris's
And this could be your very last time seein her
One look at me and you better believe that I be g'n her
So come alone or don't come at all (why?)
Cause it's real big pimpin at this playa's ball
True it's, usually not represented right
But with me it's all to the g and tonight's the night

Oh, don't let me out of your sight

So don't let me have any rights

Oh, I've had it up to here!

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

Oh, I've had it up to here!

Oh, am I making myself clear?
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be

Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worry some
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies

Well an old man said to me in a voice filled with pain
"Where you going young man?"
Said "I'm going to fight a war
Gonna fight for my country in some foreign land"
He said "The sun will never hurt you, never harmed anyone
But you must realize
If you try to stare her down, she will win in the end
She will burn your eyes"
She will burn them

Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get to Heaven

He said "Boy I was young once, yeah, I was tough
Sailing on Uncle Sam's boat
Hey I could kill the enemy; I could die on foreign streets
But I could not vote
But now you walk by me; you won't talk to me
Say this is my fate
But every time you walk the streets boy
Most of them you meet
You see, it's you they hate
It's you they hate

Seen a million faces
Seen a million places die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get to Heaven
I hope I get there

Seen a million places
Seen a million faces die
And I wonder who will walk with me
When I get there

See this woman sitting next to me
She's been there for a long, long time
And when I fell, she picked me up
And when I cried, she wiped my tears
I thank god she's mine
And when I leave this world
She won't have anything but her love for me
'Cause the man took everything else and made me hate myself
So just let her be boy
Won't you let her be

Seen a million faces die
Seen a million mothers die
Seen a million brothers die

I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And drank till I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and fan

Well, okay I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

Well, okay I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes
And everywhere in between
Well, okay we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad?

@@@
It felt like spring time on this February morning
In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though i am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why (ooh la kah koh)

when the sun comes out again (ooh la kah koh)
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again oh
when the sun comes out again
when the sun comes out again mmh (ooh la kah koh)

I will wake up happy (ooh la kah koh)

This I pray

B-Boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past.
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper.
Before I make you suffer That's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot?
Surely I can, if you the man.
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice.
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang
get it on.
You're gettin' warm.
I can feel you getting closer.
Now baby, down this Mimosa.
You better believe it's time to give a toast to.
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played.
Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade.
All over your body.
Who's body?
You're body.
I can rock a party like nobody.
Leavin' time to take home the loot.
Choosy about who I let knock my boots.
Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte.
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right.

CHORUS:

Keep On' Keepin On, Cause you came and you changed my world.
Your love so brand new. Keep on keep kickin' on. Doin it right, right,
right... Ah, ah, ah....

Beware of the stare when I step into peace.
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released.
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes.
I found me a new nigga this year.
That know's how to handle this here.
Now I look forward to goin' home at night.
Brother does mo right.
Under the candlelight.
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
I guess I can.
Can I, why not?
If I wanna guess I can. Can I?
More honey than a bumble-bee hive.
Pulling 69 ways in my archive.
Sweet like licorice.
Sugar for my booga.
Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee.
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check.
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat.
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to.
As I procede to Open up and feed you.
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be.
Been I can, I get rid of all company.

CHORUS

Many have tried strict regulation.
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation.
Those that didn't perform well.
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell.
You're playing with my time.
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me.
You better work me.
While you got the oppurtunity.
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E.
Only the strong survive.
Only the wise excel.
Once said by my born-in-hell.
Only the lonely die slowly.
Left all alone try to control me.
Easy does it never ask how was it.
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets.
Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute.
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot.
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it.
Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it.
It's natural. Never be ashamed.
Fuck the fame. Get the name, and kick the game.

The little white lies too
Sometimes, tell me

Just by mistake
Accidentally do you say my name?

Hmm...
Oh, oh...
Ooh, ooh...
Oh, yeah...
Oh, oh...

Last night, I slept alone - I stayed at home
For the first time since you've been gone, baby...
No friends to understand, to lend a helping hand,
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known...

How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;
Don't you remember that you promised me? Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy...
But you went away, baby, and it's such a shame;
How could you turn your back on me? Oh...

(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me,) If you don't need me...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?) Tell me who do you love, boy?
(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me,) If you don't need me...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?)

I gave, gave everything a man could ever need;
I was there whenever you would call me, baby...
But somehow, your feelings changed, you don't act the same;
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all...

How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;
Don't you remember that you promised me? Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy...
Now the love is gone, baby - tell me what went wrong?
How could you leave me hanging on? Oh, baby...

(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me,) Oh, oh, oh...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?) Tell me who do you love? Yeah...
(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me,) If you don't need me...
(If you really don't love me,) Tell me, yeah... (then who do you love?) Ooh, oh!

(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me,) If you don't need me...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?) Tell me who do... who do you love, boy?
(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (f you really don't need me,) Oh, no...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?) Tell me who do you love?

I once was blind but, baby, now I see, yeah, (Now I see...)
That I'm not the one who can fill your every need... (Fill your need...)
I painted a picture so clear, it's reality; (Reality...)
Now I know, yes, I know, that you're not the one for me...

Oh, baby!
(If you really don't want me, if you really don't need me,) Oh, yeah!
(If you really don't love me, then who do u love?) Who do you love, baby?
(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me,) If you don't need me...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?)

How could you walk away from me? Baby, you promised you'd never leave!
Slept alone since you've been gone - the greatest pain I've ever known... (Who do you love?)

(If you really don't want me...) Oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, yeah...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?) Oh, oh, baby!

(If you really don't want me, if you really don't need me,) If you don't love me...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?) Tell me, tell me, who do you love, boy?

(If you really don't want me,) Oh, baby... (If you really don't need me,) If you don't need me...

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart

Take back that sad word,"goodbye"
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many, many nights
Un-break my, un-break my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart, sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on

(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)

You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C.
Woe, oh is me, that's what I get for trickin
Pay my own bail, commence to ass kickin
Lick in the door, wavin the four-four
All you heard was, "Poppa don't hit me no more"
Disrespect my click, my shit's imperial
Fuck around and made her milkbox material
You feel me? Suckin dick, runnin your lips
'Cause of you, I'm on some real fuck a bitch shit, uhh..

Fuck bitches, get money.. fuck niggaz, get money [x3]

[Big] WHAT? I see mad girls like you

[Lil' Kim]
Uhh, whoo! Get at me
Whoo, I told you niggaz
Niggaz.. betta grab a seat
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch six feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard now, niggaz press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killin than the stick up jooks
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cummin down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze nigga
Don'tcha, you wanna lick between my knees nigga
Don'tcha wanna see me whippin your 3 down the Ave.
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs lick shots in the air
You get vexed, and start swingin everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your nine, while I cock on mine
Yeah what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what nigga? I'm not tryin to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vitadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up, for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards, sayin, "I apologize"
Is you wit me? How could you ever decieve me
But payback's a bitch motherfucker, believe me
Naw I ain't gay this aint no lesbo flow
Just a lil somethin, to let you motherfuckers know

Fuck bitches, get money.. fuck niggaz, get money [repeat to end]

[Big] Oh you want my numbers and shit

Verse 1: Belo
7 double oh P.M.
Fly low to them hoes in the B M
Sippin' Seagram, chewin' on a weed stem
Touchin' on my fo' fin
Move it to the back so I can see who beepin' this Po' Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shited with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
3-line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
& plus we strapped with 2 protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
& the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe
To the crib.

Chorus: T-Pain

Verse 2: AK-47, Belo
7 deuce 5, the ride the point to spot the live hoes
3 miles per hour
Like we runnin' up on some rivals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly 'Lo
Introduce myself
A to the muthafuckin' K finna recognize
Then I lose myself juice myself
As you take one pull, uhh, pass it to the left & umm
Self-centered niggas'll take 2 pulls
Cause they thinkin' about samplin' umm
P I M P, ology, but logically
We learnin' these hoes biology & obviously, well...

Mmm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the C A
D I Double L with ah A C, A C hoes
They peep those, P I M P & they think that automatically
Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be, full of that
M O N E but why?
Cause nigga be sportin' nice cars & fancy clothes
Fresh jewels Girbaud flexin' 1 5 oh (chop chop)
Chop up that paper hoe, chop up that paper hoe
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fuckin' with a pimp doe
Get involved in the backseat
Let's have me in the cab betcha mess with ya young ass
Smokin' on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last
P I M P, ology, but logically
We learnin' these hoes biology & obviously, well...

Verse 3: Twista
Well a muthafucker might be broke & shit
& then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spittin' mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the Oprah lips & the provokin' hips & never gotta tell her many lies
I been lookin' in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex & some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo' when outta me gotta be right, that'd be the flatter me right
But if the head the bonk come on suck a nigga dick
Members of my click, wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus & deny that
I done got a hold of them my fellas on the train
while she lie back, now muthafucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your hoe
Tryin' to come up on another G
The broad all up under me tryin' to smother me
Lookin' lovely while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbin' me with lotion
Comin' like an ocean coastin have a cig thinkin' me & Do Or Die dig drinkin' love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be givin' women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
& if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't trickin the Feds or spittin' game but it's chicken and bread
Kickin' them legs in the air like a player do
Then belittle in a day or 2
After words I'm a slay a crew
Now that's some pimp type shit that B-Low & AK'll do
Wearing gray & blue
If a hoe wanna holler then you a player if you hit them ends & get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same hoe to wanna freak your friends
Cause I studied P I M P ology, but logically
Be learnin' these hoes biology, obviously, well...

Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays, now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me

Until it sleeps
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
I don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you

Until it sleeps
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)

I don't want it, no
Don't want it, want it, want it, no

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me til I'm clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps

Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps

Sittin on a quarter 'p of hay
Thangs is feelin good today.
I'm tore up,from the floor up
Sippin on some crown royal.
Trippin,in a circle of wood
Where everybody smoke they own bud.
Good ole' hay
How you feel today?
Fine,blowed and dandy.
Silly like i'm hype off candy.
Gotta big,thick chic named sandy.
In the farm in the middle of the barn
Where everybody's feelin crazy.
I went to visit granny's house.
Now i see why don't nobody leave.
We constantly,constantly,constantly smokin b's.
Too blitzed to even shake it off
But i still got my head up.
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn
And get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut,
Blaze it up so i can hit that bud.
Git me zoned and i'll be on.
Cuz i love to smoke upon hay.

(chorus)
Smokin on
Haaayy in the middle of the barn.
Smokin on
Haaayy in the middle of the barn.

The hay got me goin through a stage
And i just can't get enough.
Smokin everyday
I got some hay
And you know i'm finna roll it up.
Make a cloud
I'm gonna take my mind away from all the
Bullcrap.
Bump my sounds
Lay back and roll
Mack to the freaks that's on the road.
Sometimes i wonder
When i was blowed on the streets.
Anybody wanna step to me,
I'ma see how rough they be.
In this session,manifesting
On myp's and q's
Never snooze cause i refuse.
Inhale,exhale the smell.
Smokin hay all by myself.
Wildstle,laughin loud.
Wit my homies by my side.
If somethin jump off let it ride
On my square when time is live.
Everybody throw it up
Go to the barn and get some hay.
When i get my choke on.
Fool you know i'm smokin on......

Hay now hay
We smokin up hay in the middle of the barn
And i'm lit up
Can't get up
My eyes are red
And my head is spinnin.
Took another pull
Ridin red bull
Got the goofies, can't stop grinnin.
Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids
And we bout to get in em.
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at
And everything funny.
Gotta pause some nigga tryin' to blow my high
Smokin all that hay with no money.
Now truly this bitch wanna do me
So i hit the 151bacardi
She high like the sun
Thick like cornbread,and i'm ready to party.
That hay got me so gotdamn horny
But i don't like that tramp.
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie
cause the hoe had a book of foodstamps.
And i got the munchies
I need soul food.
Collard greens or pinto beans.
If you smoke hay like the conflict do,
Then you know what the hell i mean.

(chorus)

Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat dorr crack.
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that
Hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb,
I creeped up on the wall and all i heard.
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in
The hay
With a funky dime word.
Couldn't be myself
Couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If i didn't pass it to the left.
Nigga would have lost my breath.
Open up the window 'fore i fall and faint
But i can't
Cause i roll around in dat barn ride.
Rollin up the hootie hoo
Roughest skin roller on dat west side.
Nigga come on in
I got some hay
Won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for?
Ain't nobody to rich, we poor.
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn
The flies keep us chokin.
Thank you jesus christ
For all the hay you're givin us
Cause we'll keep on smokin'.

'Cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

Only wanna be with you

Only wanna be with you

Ohh my baby.

Please my baby,

My baby,

When we were young,
And truth was paramount.
We were older then,
And we lived a life without any doubt.
Those memories,
They seem so long ago.

What's become of them?
When you feel like me I want you to know.

Don't cry.
Not alone.
Don't cry,
Tonight, my baby.
Don't cry,
You'll always be loved.

Today I dreamed,
Of friends I had before.
And I wonder why.
The ones who care don't call anymore.
My feelings hurt.
But you know I overcome the pain.
And I'm stronger now,
There can't be a fire unless there's a flame.

Don't cry.
Your not alone.
Don't cry,
Tonight, my baby.
Don't cry.

Don't cry oh...

Don't leave me now,
'Cause I'm afraid what you've done to me.
Is now the wolf.
In my bed,

In my head.
In my head.
In my head.

The challenges, we took were hard enough.
They get harder now.
Even when we think that we've had enough.
Don't feel alone,
'Cause it's I who understands,
I'm your sedative,
Take a piece of me whenever you can.

Don't cry.... you're not alone.
...don't be so hard on yourself...

Don't cry.... tonight my baby
...These tears are for.....someone else...

Don't cry.... you'll always be loved
...I hear your voice on the phone...

Don't cry.... tonight sweet baby
