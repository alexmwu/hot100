Where is the moment when needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well all that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

(A holiday)
You had a bad day
(A holiday)
You had a bad day
(A holiday)
You had a bad day

Nelly: Am I throwing you off?
Timbaland: Nope
Nelly: Didn't think so

Timbaland: How you doin' young lady?
That feelin' that you givin' really drives me crazy
You don't have to play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light

You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
Will you still respect me if you get it?

All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want

Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?

Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
Are you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kind of cute

Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'mma lay mine's down

I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'mma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health

I want you on my team
So does everybody else

Shh, baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know

If you with it girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want

Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?

Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
Are you ready?

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

(Bring that on?)You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things

I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want

Promiscuous boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait

Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

Promiscuous boy
We're one and the same
So we don't gotta play games no more

My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you

Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting, no fighting
We got the Refugees up in here
No fighting, no fighting
Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama, si, bonita, si, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Don't you see baby, asi es perfecto

Oh I know I am on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection
Shakira, Shakira

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan

My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dia
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dia

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

Senorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia

Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi, say it
Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi

Yeah
She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me
Back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates for humpty humpty
I need a whole club dizzy

Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I am on tonight and my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting

I am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined

I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah
Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries
Are outside the lines
We've been conditioned
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, oh

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin

Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else

I remember when,
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
But there was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mmm

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having
The time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice

Come on now, who do you,
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them

Mm-hmm, ever since I was little
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come, mmm
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Think they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by, they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen

Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma

Girl you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' to bone ain't tryin' to have no babies
Rock clean itself, so I pull in ladies
Laws of patrollin' you know they hate me

Music turned all the way up until the maximum
I can speak for some niggas try to jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have & um
Will have a nigga locked up in the maximum

Security cell, I'm grippin' oak
Music loud & tippin' slow
Twist and twistin' like hit this dough
Pull up from behind & is in his throat

Windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD's change, niggas like, "Who is that producin'?"
This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston, but I still ain't losin'

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud ,I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

I been drinkin' and smokin' holdin' shit
'Cause a brother can't focus
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope
This big ol' Excursion swervin' all up in the curve, man

Nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey
And the gin again is in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I come from the block
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck

I got a revolver in my right hand
40 oz. on my lap freezin' my balls
Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawg

I gotta get back to backstreets
Wanted by the six pound and I got heat
Glock glock, shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key

With no regards for the law we dodge 'em like fuck 'em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark, but well if you want, nigga you poppin' dark
Ready or not we bust shots off in the air, Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Do what you thinkin' so, I tried to let you go
Turn up a blink of light and then I swang it slower
A nigga upset for sure 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drinkin' drough

So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rear view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong well keep tryin'
'Cause they denyin' is racial profilin'

Houston, Texas you can check my tags
Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

And been a baller that I am I talk to them
Givin' a damn 'about not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood

I'm a laugh at you and then I'm a have to cruise
I'm in number two on some more DJ Screw
You can't arrest me plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws tellin' them "We hate you!"

I can't be toss or tell 'em that they should've known
Tippin' down I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me I'm about to pull up at your home, it's on

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Oooo (oh, oh, oh, oh) oooo

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cuz a love like this takes some time

People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)

It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real shit (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)

Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)

I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

See this is real talk
I'm always stay (no matter what)
Good or bad (thick and thin)
Right or wrong (all day, every day)

Now if you're down on love or don't believe
This ain't for you (no, this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true (come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (hands up)

Fellas tell your lady she's the one (fellas tell your lady she's the one, oh)
Put your hands up (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love
Look him right in his eyes and tell him
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cuz I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

Heeeeeeeeeeeey ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
Heeeeeeeeeeeey ohhhhhhhhhhhhh

I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you

I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewin' on aluminum foil
Smilin', showin' off my diamonds sippin on some potin oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real

My motivation is from thirty pointers V VS the furniture
My mouthpiece simply symbolize success
I got da wrist wear and neck wear that's captivatin'
But it's my smile that's got these on-lookers spectatin'

My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carats than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin', givin' everybody chills
Call me George Foreman, 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grillz

Smile for me daddy(What you lookin at?)

I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth

But that's how it's got to be
It's comin' down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along

But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the arguments in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on, oh

And suddenly, I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless

Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground in the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Everyone knows she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...

Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

Niggas in my face
Damn near er' day
Askin a million questions like
Joc where ya stay?
Tell 'em College Park
Where they chop cars
Eat 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, jays on my feet
I'm on that Patron so get like me
'69 cutlass wit the bucket seat
Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto'
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin' dough
If a girl choose let her do her thang
Just like her mama and I ain't sayin the name brain
Er'body love me I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why
I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do (OK)

(Chorus - repeat 2X)
Meet me in the trap, it's goin down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin down
Meet me in the club, it's goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Verse numba 2, do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck pockets full of Ben Franks
When I'm in the mall hoes just pause
I pop a few tags give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work make the block bump
Boys in the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boi magic seven days a week
Numba one record long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me betta yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew we ceritifed stars
Ready in the front bout 35 cars
Bitches in the back
Black beamer coups
Girls like girls time to recruit
If ya got a problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

(Chorus)

Time to set it off, let these niggas know
Have ya every seen a chevy wit the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet
Feds on my trail, but they thank I don't know
I keep my hands clean cuz I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask 'em how I know, it's me, surprise!
Put it in the air, rep where ya stay
Take a step back blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats

You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you

I'm the question and you're, of course, the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer

Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you, I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock

Take on me(uh huh)you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making(Y-O-U)this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me

And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging

SOS please somebody help me, yeah
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard(are you making this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

@@@
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder: getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

Step one: you say we need to talk
He walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you,
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along
In the bitterness and
I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along
In the bitterness and
I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along
In the bitterness and
I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life


Where did I go wrong?

I would have stayed up with you all night

Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore

I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door

That every time I see you everything starts making sense

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you

She says she's no good
With words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantical stuck to my tongue

Weighed down with words too
Over-dramatic
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse"
Versus "no one should ever feel like"

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by

Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love if they knew
How misery loved me

You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake and

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love

Why don't you show me the little bit of spine

I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm

And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his

You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money

She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money(money...money)
If you ain't no punk
Holla we want prenup (We want prenup!)

Yeah, it's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave your ass she gon' leave with half

You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries

So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl

You, you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind

I got my hoe on my right side, pouring some cups
My whole hood is on to left and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today

But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jets
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet, 'cause you can

And switch it till you running right out of breath
And take a break until you ready again
And you can invite over as many friends

As you want to, but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to
Hey, hey, Luda, I am on top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of your frame

And I just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves
And let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius

Yup, call me the renaissance man
Get up and I stay harder then a cinderblock man
Hey i'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meaning to tell you that I really must thank ya when ya

Shake your money maker

Please don't stop until it hurt, girl
You, you been looking a little tipsy
So if you could just shake it a little this way

See I'm a member of the BBC
The original breadwinner of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad
'Cause everybody in the camp is like"Oh my God, she can-"

Shake your money maker

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh oh oh
Oh god I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh oh oh
Oh god I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
It's time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh

Ooh
Ooh

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Because of you
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in

Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long

And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while

Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

Whoa whoa
Do do do do do
Yeah
Yeah

Verse 1
Yo,
Tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick
That a young'n
Never seen before

I said Yo,
Tell her girls I want to meet her (meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I got to give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it
There she is I got to stop her

Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time
She's out the door
I got to go for mine

I think I'll say

Chorus
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby

Verse 2
Now shorty grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the flow is ours
You say you don't really dance

Don't worry about it
We'll just one, two, step
One, two, step

Now if the music is moving too fast
Grab my hand a little tighter
Don't be afraid to move a little closer

Girl, there is something about you that makes me want to say

Chorus (x2)
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby

Breakdown
I want to be where you are,
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing.

Baby it's so romantic.

Baby I can be in your heart.

So many things I want to tell you,
I think that I should start by saying "Yo."

I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

I got to give her game proper,
Ppit it so she get it,
There she is - I got to stop her.

I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I look to keep you here with me oh baby.

Spoken
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (like this),
Just clap your hands like this (whooo like this).

And if your shorty is in the house tonight,
Just grab her by the hand homie,
Make her understand y'all was made to dance like this (like this).

Y'all was made to bounce like this (whoa like this).

Just let her know she was made for you,
And you want to do everything she want to man.

Laughs

Whoo!

You've got your mother and your brother
Every other, undercover
Telling you what to say
You think I'm stupid
But the truth is that it's cupid
Baby, loving you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hand off of my trigger, oh yeah
You need to know
The situations getting old
And now the more you talk the less I can take, oh

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I waited here for you
Like a kid waiting after school
So tell me, how come you never showed? (show)
I gave you everything
And never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (alone)
So before you start defendin'
Baby, stop all your pretendin'...
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow
Let's get this show on the road today, hey...

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I want a love, I want a fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me, die for me
Live and breathe for me
Do you care for me
Cause if you don't then just leave

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away

If you don't have the answer (walk away)
Walk away (just walk away)
Just leave (walk away)

Details don't matter

Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I want to reach out to you
But I turn around and I let it ride

Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart
And I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to

What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny

So baby we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do it like me
She'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait

Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know
You know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long

I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand

I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know
You know, you know

That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long

I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you

I have loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing

'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing

'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go

@@@
Watch my life,
Pass me by,
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't want to waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes

Yeah...

'Cause I want you,
And I feel you,
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger,
Like a burning,
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken,
And I'm fading,
I'm half the man I thought I would be,
But you can have what's left of me

I've been dying inside,
Little by little,
No where to go,
But going out of my mind
In endless circles,
Running from myself until,
You gave me a reason for standing still

And I want you,
And I feel you,
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger,
Like a burning,
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken,
And I'm fading,
I'm half the man I thought I would be,
But you can have what's left of me

Falling faster,
Barely breathing,
Give me something,
To believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head

Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole
Once again

'Cause I want you,
And I feel you,
Crawling underneath my skin
A hunger,
Like a burning,
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken,
And I'm fading,
I'm half the man I thought I would be
You can have all that's left, yeah yeah yeah
What's left of me?

I've been dying inside you see
I'm going out my
Out my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?

Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Take what's left of me...

(feat. Ciara)

(Chorus: Ciara)
They say he do a little of this
He do a little of that
He's always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He got a lot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say he think he's slick
He got a lot of chips
He's so messed up, I heard
He's been locked up Find Somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what
So what
So what
So what

(Verse 1: Field Mob)
And they say I'm a slut, I'm a hoe, I'm a freak
I got a different girl every day of the week
You too smart to
You'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard
That they say about me
They say I done this
They said I done that
But all of it's fiction none of it's facts
But you don't be hearing that about your love
You let it go in one ear and out the other
The he say, she say, they say, I heard
The beef ain't, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes there
Nothing but liars hating I bet
They wouldn't mind trading places
With you by my side in my Mercedes

(Chorus: Ciara)
They say he do a little of this
He do a little of that
He's always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp

(Verse 2: Field Mob)
Mo' money mo' problems
Life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a wedding
So what, that's your cousin
That don't mean nothing
Her like missing in a tight of affection
You get, you just blind to the facts
See the lies, just obvious drives for attention
You to the fine just supply your suspicious
But listen, say you love me
Gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess
Break up never, they just jealous
Drama for your mama, mean mug for your brother
I'm the author of the book nigga judge by the cover, yes
I-I been to jail, yes
I-I'm grinding for real and
I'm positive, they talking negative pimp
They hate to see you doing better then them, so

(Chorus: Ciara)
They say he do a little of this
He do a little of that
He's always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp

Some people don't like it
'Cause you hang out in the streets
But you're my boyfriend
You've always been here for me
This love is serious
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for you
And I don't care what they say
Some people don't like it
'Cause you hang out in the streets
But you're my boyfriend
You've always been here for me
I like the thug in you
No matter what people think

And I don't care what they say

(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

I felt a little fear, upon my back
I said, "Don't look back, just keep on walking."
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
When the big black horse said, "Look this way."
He said, "Hey lady, will you marry me?"
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

But I said, "No, no. No, no-no-no.
"No, no. You're not the one for me.
"No, no. No, no-no-no.
"No, no. You're not the one for me."

(Ooooo, woo-hoo)

No, no, no, no.

And my heart had a problem, in the early hours,
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that,
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Now It won't come back, cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

And It said, "No, no, no, no-no-no.
"No, no, you're not the one for me.
"No, no, no, no-no-no.
"No, no, you're not the one for me."

(Ooooo, woo-hoo) (not the one for me, yeah-eh)
(Ooooo, woo-hoo)
Said no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no
You're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no
You're not the one for me

Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me

Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"

Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly

Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy

I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me

There she goes shakin' that ass on the flow
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control.

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up

Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit.

Nate Dogg
2 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat

3 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey

I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock

Get ya ass off the wall with your 2 left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie.

We about to have a party
Let's get it started
Go ahead shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be givin' it up.

Nate Dogg
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me.

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow, and I'll finish

Yeah me and Nate D-O-double G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party.

Nate Dogg
Have a party
Turn the music up
Let's get it started
Go ahead shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut. Would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine.

Eminem
Now imma hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind.

Even though I'm on tha road doin shows,
I make time for me n her, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her
May conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her,
(Uh) I thought i was your man
Guess u ain't understand,
N now I'm sittin herre, lookin crazy like
Damn!

(Chorus)
Every time I try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that
Everything gon be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
It was meant to be,
You were meant for me,
So that means we gotta make it work

(Verse 2)
Walkin to house from hard work, my head hurts,
Instead of arguin, can i have dinner with some dessert (uh uh)
She talkin 'bout this phone number she found,
Hey, give me time to put my bags down,
She's straight up, clowned
Before we end up fightin, let me leave,
I'm exhausted and dis hurr, I don't need
Now I'm wit the fellas ridin n drinkin
She's blowin my two way up but I need some time for thinkin
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something sayin naaaw
Give her some space and the next day I might call
What should I do
Look, let me ask ya'll
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed
But it happens some time
It's either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man
Guess u ain't understand
N now I'm sittin' herre lookin crazy like
Damn!

(Chorus)
Every time I try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that
Everything gon be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life

You were meant for me,
So that means we gotta make it work

(JD:) Chingy holla at dem agian !!

(Verse 3)
Ta all the fellas know u feel me, if u eva had a woman,
Good times led to bad times n u ain't see it coming,
Try the best to make her happy,
But it wasn't enough,
Cuz mamma told me in relationship to roll ya bluff
N i don't wanna have my head down
Weak n stressed out
As bad as it hurts i gotta move to the next round
(Uh) I thought i was her man
Guess she ain't understand
N now she's sittin' hurr lookin crazy like
Damn!

(Chorus)
Every time I try to leave
Somethin keeps pullin me back, me back
Telling me I need u in my life
Every time I try to go
Somethin keeps tellin me that, me that

Hey a,

Screw it up make it go extra slow
Real girls get down on the flo (on the flo get down, on the flo)
Ooh I gave you a taste you want some more

I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh from the 6-4 hefers up in Crenshaw

Convict, up front
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one
Could she be that lady

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Up front style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed down
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now

(I feel it) Go on and crack now
(Oh, I see it) Don't let back now
(I'm-a call her) Then I put the mack down
(Money? No problem) Pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Eminem
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when I throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they goin' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it

Pedicure, manicure, kitty cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Pretty Cat Dolls
Try'na hold my woody back through my drawers

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're
I'm like, I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place

Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got a pal, every gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing! (Akon!)

Akon
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo

Women just hoin', big booty rollin'
Soon I be all in them an' throwin' D

Hittin' no less than three
Block will style like wee, wee
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo

Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life
And you'd be my wife, make it right this time

Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her "get another round"
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground

I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known

And like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back
The seeds I've sown, saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million miles of memories on that road
And every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known,
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road, feels like I've never left
That's how the story goes

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Whooo umm yeah...
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside ev'ry darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood
I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
Whooo

Ah gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah

Life is a highway

If you're going my way (you're going my way)

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye

Ooooo...Yeah!

There ain't no load that I can't hold
A road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (all night long)
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Ah gimme gimme gimme, ah gimme gimme yeah

Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

Should I let you fall and lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late

Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

Couldn't take the blame
Sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated
No wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me
Come find me
Make up your mind

You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over
It's over

How could I have burned paradise?
How could I? You were never mine

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me
Just get your things

She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Ohhh...

Tanight pedicures, walkin on better floors
Beat it in your S Don, Jimmy Choo, better stores

(unintelligble singing)

Mother: Hi Justin! This is your mother. It's 2:33 on Monday afternoon. I was just calling to see how you were doing. You sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous too.I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too. You know I love ya! Take care honey I know you're under a lot of pressure. See ya. Bye, bye!

I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I'll never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, "Make it go away"
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
And then she whispered, "How can you do this to me?"

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
For you

Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

Let me put my two cents in it
One, just be patient
Don't be rushing
Like you're anxious
And two, your just too aggressive
Trying to get your Ahh

And I don't want to go there

They only want
Only want my ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha-ha
Only want what they want
But, na, ah-ah

Haters want 2 fight me I'm snatching ya ass up

Respect my whole squad no you can't even touch us 'cause

Look, we gotta talk
Dang, I know, I know
But it's just
There's some things I got to get off my chest alright

Yeah

Baby, come in, sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say, so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been
No walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I'm finished, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

How do you let it go? When you
You just don't know? What's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand
'Cause I know

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I
Found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world, and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart, and I wanna know

How do you let it go? When you
You just don't know? What's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out, talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand
What I'm tryin'a say
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along
Girl how you not gonna see it?

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I kinda gotta figure out what I need

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it
I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby, I
I just can't do it
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry

Do you hear me crying?
There's never a right time

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I kinda gotta figure out what I need
(About you and me)
There's never a right time to say goodbye
(Oh, no, it ain't)
But we know that we gotta go
(Go)
Our separate ways
(Ways)
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time
Right time to say goodbye

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move, 'cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I kinda gotta figure out what I need

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but I gotta do it
And it's killing me

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door

And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care,
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Please Lord don't let me go to jail tonight (Yeah)
Who Me?? I'm a Soul Survivor
Ask about 'em in the street, the boy Jeezy a rida (Jeezy a rida)
A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah life sucks (Ha Ha)
Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks (Ayy)

Another day, another dolla (dolla)-same block, same nigga, same part, same green

We let the Thugs do it for us--we don't cry tears (That's right)
Real niggaz don't budge
When Mail Man got his time he shot birds at the judge (Yeah)

So when it's time to read up, I'm knee deep in the 'caine (Damn)

And this is er'day, it never gets old (Old)

Gotta drive real cool when them pi's be on you (pi's be on you)
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous (ball outrageous)
Them alphabet boards gotta us under survalence (Ayy)

The same nigga that's a star when you put 'em on stages
I ain't cheat--played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself
(Let's Get It) No nuts, no glory (no glory)
My biography, you damn right, the true story (Yeah)
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try (try)
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ayy)

(Bridge - Akon)
Cause if you lookin' for me you you can find me
On the block disobeyin' the law

Pants saggin' with my gun in my draws

90@Eminem@When I'm Gone
@@@
Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
"Daddy, look what I made.", dad's gotta go catch a plane

"Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?"
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine."

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya."

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right," and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

"You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone."

But baby wait, "It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream "Die Shady!" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

Heyyyy

Ridin in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breakin down the good green, rollin the blunt
Ghetto pimp tight girls say I'm the mayne
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Ridin through the hood, got me grippin the grain
And I'm sippin the same, while I'm changin the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm cho-ckin the green
Vision messed up cause I'm drinkin to lean
Messin with a D-Boy, ridin them big toys
Make your man-gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part and be buyin the bar

(DJ Paul)
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drink around me believe your drink gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me if she bad she gonna get stuck
These niggaz is spies, we live them lives
And keep them knives tight, ridin round what they like
Make a couple numb, a couple will die
So purple, p-purple, p-purple and swallow it down with
the yurple, yurple, yurple
It's goin dowwwwwn

(Young Buck)
Puff puff pass nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke a swunt
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggaz can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed, fuck these hoes and stack my g'z
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po, close the window
when I roll the indo
Know they mad, cause I'm rollin Benzo
This that purple, not pretend though

Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own cause them niggaz there
let me smoke for free

(Crunchy Black)
What's up Mary? (how you doin?), Mary Jane (stalkin me)
Since I have met ya girl you ruined my brain (ruined my brain)
You stole my heart (stole my heart), right from the start (right from the start)
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the garden (put you in the garden)

(Hook)

(Eightball)
Shrimp roll, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650, have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughin and chockin constantly
Taste like soup when you hit it, gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's to me the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

(MJG)
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that, super incredible
have a nigga runnin back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at?
Cuttin up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the mornin, when I need this and breath again a whole lotta weed but uh
I'm needin somebody to give me what I need
when I want nothin less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, Eightball and MJG
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy

Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out ya mouth

And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
why you playing games, what's this all about
And I can't believe,
You're hurting me
I met your girl, what a difference
What you see in her
You ain't see in me
But I guess it was all just make-believe

(Chorus)

Oh, Love
never knew what I was missing
but I knew once we start kissin'
I found......
Love
never knew what I was missin'
but I knew once we start kissin'
I found.....

(Verse 2)

Now you're gone, what am I gonna do
I'm so empty
my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on without you....
My rainy days fade away, when you
come around please tell me baby
why you go so far away
Why you go...

(Chorus)

Love......
never knew what I was missing
but I knew once we start kissin'
I found......

I found you

Now you go, what am I gonna do
I'm sooo empty

I'm sorry that seeing you mad is so sexy

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place?
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down?
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy
When you're mad

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place?
Could it be the lil' way that you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down?
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're so damn sexy
When you're mad

Hey T.I.P pimpin'
Hey shorty why you gotta act like that? I'm sayin'...
I'm just tryin' to be nice to you.

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that...hey-hey.

Can't help but notice how you glowin' I can see in yo face
Now I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that you need yo' space
Selling niggas is one thing you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo' knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you makin, get yo' knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I gotta mansion and a gate, you wit me you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck wit 23's the case
600 Gz in the safe. How much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word we can leave today, this somethin' special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing makin' you sad makin' you stay

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that...hey-hey.

Can he touch you like that, and make you make you feel like this
Holla if you came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest
Take advantage of what you concealing in your dress
What, he think he to fresh to show you that you the best
Compliment you on your hair and legs and treat you wit respect
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissin' on yo neck
It's been awhile since she got it like this I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
No, you confused ain't decided which way you should go yet.
So how you keep sayin' no when your panties so wet?

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that...hey-hey.

This nigga playin' mind games man
I think the time came, that you mind changed you understand
Life is like a chess move, you need to make yo next move
Yo' best move, keep it pimpin' you understand...hey
I mean you know what I'm sayin' I done showed you how I feel
You know what I'm sayin' I put myself all the way out there you know
The ball in yo' court man, but I just got a question for you...
Is you happy??

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack

Stupid girls

Stupid girl, stupid girls, stupid girls
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughing loud so all the little people stare
Looking for a daddy to pay for the champagne
(Drop a name)
What happened to the dreams of a girl president
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Break it down now)
The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take any more
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see
Disaster's all around
A world of despair
My only concern:
Will it fuck up my hair!

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno Paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl
Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

(Do ya thing, do ya thing, do ya thing)
(I like this, like this, like this)
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair I'll suck it girl, stupid girl!
Pretty will you fuck me girl, silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair I'll suck it girl, stupid girl!

Baby if I act like that, flipping my blond hair back
Push up my bra like that, stupid girl!

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're damned as free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss because I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

De La Soul
Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining them up like ass cracks
Ladies, ponies, at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear reppin' in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahaa
Yo, we goin' ghost town
This Motown,
With yo sound
You in the blink
Gon bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With yo sound
You kill the Inc.
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you jet ahead
Yo, watch the way I navigate

She got me doin da dishes
Anythang she want for some kisses
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin like she want me
She cuttin off all my homies
Even all my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinking 'bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me...
And I'm takin everythang with me...
Well it all come down to her...

So we went our separate ways...
It's been a couple of days...
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gone do
And I'm feeling so free...
With nobody but me...
Now I can handle all my business
All my fellas can I get a witness
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her...
Now I'm leavin quickly...
Before she come and try to get me...
And I'm takin everythang with me...
Well it all come down to her...

99@Taylor Hicks@Do I Make you Proud
@@@
I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall

My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know

I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now(stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out(never been afraid)
But do I make you proud?

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud?
But do I make you proud?

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud

Wondering the streets, in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet
As what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair
round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you
What I feel about you.

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
and cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will

Forgive me if I st-stutter
From all of the clutter in my head
Cuz I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water bed
Do I seem familiar, I've crossed you in hallways
a thousand times, no more camouflage
I want to be exposed, and not be afraid to fall.

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you

If I could dim the lights in the mall
And create a mood I would
Shout out your name so it echos in every room
I would

That's what I'd do, That's what I'd do to get through to you, yeah

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
