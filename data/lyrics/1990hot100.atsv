I know this pain(I know this pain)
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains?(these chains)
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind, mmm
Is it really fair to feel this way inside? Whoa

Someday, somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you gonna let them hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know? Don't you know things'll change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

You could sustain(you could sustain)
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness(no, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess(ooh)
Letting your worries pass you by(letting your worries pass you by)
Baby, don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind?(no, no)

Someday, somebody's gonna make you want to turn around and say goodbye

Hold on for one more day, and ya
Break free from the chains

Must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, this air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love(must have been love)but it's over now(it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love(must have been love)but it's over now(it's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love(must have been love)but it's over now(it's over now)
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love(must have been love)but it's over now(it's over now)
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love(must have been love)but it's over now(it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love, but it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

(Must have been love)It must have been love
But it's over now

Relationships they seem from the start

That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her ([Biv:] wrong move you're dead)

Never trust a big butt and a smile

If I were you I'd take precaution
Before I step to meet a fly girl

You'll think she's the best thing in the world

She's so fly, she'll drive you right out of your mind
Steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' demon ooh

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me

It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own

Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized the love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that Heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny(all that I did)
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me

(Prayed through the nights)Prayed through the nights
(So faithfully)So faithfully(faithfully)
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be

She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep.
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise
Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it

Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, mmm hmm

intro
When I had you
I treated you bad
Wrong my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Oooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

chorus
Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of dispair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love everyday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

chorus

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

chorus

ad lib:
Keep the ties
Hang on tight
And don't let go
No, no, no, no
If you need him
Just keep on
Just keep on hanging on
Little trust, honesty, golden rules
Feel the strength of passion in your soul
It's burning so deep
Have faith
Just keep the fire burning at home
Hey yea
He'll come home to you
He'll be there for you
He'll want to have you

And I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed

I don't know where I'm going
Only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
A six gun lover
A candle in the wind, yeah

When you're brought into this world
They say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win

Well, they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel
Mr. Catch Me If You Can

I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
And Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun

You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
Well, I ask if I'll grow old

You ask me if I've known love
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun
Yeah

Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep

Lord, I got to ask a favor
And I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let the boy die like a man
Staring down the bullet
Let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son

Call me young gun

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh

It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, "Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa

Come on, say you will, you want me too

She was a jezebel, thisBrixtonqueen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinnin' me 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream(dream)
Love is never what it seems

When we touch
And you're holding me the way you do
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you(huh)
And show you the way I feel(huh huh huh)

She was aGeminionthe cusp of Mars
She holds me back or she too far
Windin' me up just to let her down
So emotional, gagged and bound

There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the full moon rising, I was scared
I think I was possessed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you(huh huh huh huh huh huh)
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Every time your body's next to mine
Something deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She got an attitude I can't explain
You never know if you're in frame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on the countdown till I get heard

Her blood was hot, she burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you(huh huh huh huh)

(I just wanna be close to you)
She was a jezebel, this Brixton queen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

(I just wanna be close to you)
Spinnin' me 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you(I just wanna be close to you, baby)
And show you the way I feel

I wanna be close to you(baby)
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis, the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby is in the heart of every school girl
"Love Me Tender"leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon
What could you do?

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Will it still feel the same?

How many times have I tried to turn this love around?
I don't wanna give up but, baby
It's time I had two feet on the ground(ground, ground, ground)
Can you release me?
Can you release me?

Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering
Oh if you'd have come down
From your high, would we've been all right?
Release me
Can you release me?

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy

Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That, baby, you've just got to release me

Release me
Release me

I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow
So stop coming around my door(door, door)
'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for
Whoa-oh, oh yeah

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy

Oh oh oh, baby
Come on, darlin', now hear me, darlin'

(Now tell me)
What is this power you've got on me?(What is this power)
What is this power(What is it? What is it?)

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free

Better make tracks fast on the double
The girl's jazzy, but she's nothin' but trouble - Oh!

You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just cops an attitude
Leads you on, then leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?

One day she'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her
In the end, think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me(I know)I know better than
(Better than)better than(bet-bet)better than you

She gets you hot then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
'Cause she knows you'll always give her one more try
You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playin' to the crowd
But tell me, do you really like standin' in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me(I know)I know better than
(Better than)better than(bet-bet)better than you

I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie(that would be a lie)
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried

Jump in
One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I've tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this here as a dis and a goodbye

She ain't worth it, even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry, 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy, but she's nothin' but trouble

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me(I know)I know better than

Believe me(I know)I know better than

But in a memory, I hear you calling me
Close my eyes and I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday, but then it fades away

Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain(warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers, not apart
If wishes came true

Now you're gone and I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams, I still feel your touch
Lying next to me, feeling ecstasy

Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain(warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you

And we would still be lovers, not apart

I need you badly
Give our love one more chance

Hoping that love will start

Has punched a hole in the night time mist
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime

The downtown trains are full
Full of all them Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark

Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one, oh baby
Can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night is just the same
On a downtown train

I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way

And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night its just the same
You leave me lonely

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night its just the same

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train

When you belonged to me
You were my everything
Now I'd give anything
To feel the love you bring
You were my everything

They say time can mend a broken heart
And fix you up
But my life will never, ever be the same
Without your touch
I know you're still afraid to let me in
And I don't blame you really
I wouldn't let you see me
I took for granted you would always be there

Yo, VIP, let's kick it

trippin balls




























Ice Ice Baby

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly

Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance! Go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony

Love it or leave it, you better gain way
You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon

Burning 'em if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo

Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say, "hi,"
Did you stop? No, I just drove by

Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead, yo
So, I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue

Girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine

Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells

Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack

Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene, just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground

'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this

Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, "Damn"
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram

Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla)Ice

Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother

Ice Ice Baby too cold
Ice Ice Baby too cold, too cold
Ice Ice Baby too cold, too cold
Ice Ice Baby too cold, too cold

Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in,
I'm just gon' cruise down the road,
Look at the stars in the sky,
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have,
Of a love that my heart has been searching for,
For so long, and I know somewhere,
If I keep looking, that love I'll find,
The picture grows clearer and clearer,
From the back to the front of my mind,
And like love, a love I know I'll have,
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last,

I see her face and I can't let go,
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love,

She's a thought and a vision in my memory,
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love, oh love

(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definetly needs,
(Please be mine)
Baby be mine,
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it,
(so be mine)
So why don't you be mine,
(Baby be mine)
Ah yes, be mine

The search is going on from coast to coast,
A women for the man, who's propping the most,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(Tell me have you seen her?)

My heart is beating strong,
This love cannot be wrong,
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking,

At the movies, in my car, on my stereo,
At a game, on Different World or the Cosby Show,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Yo Veo, tell me what's up,

At the track, at the club, or out buying dub,
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad

(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need,
(Please be mine)
Be mine baby,
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it,
(So baby be mine)
Why don't you be mine,
(baby, be mine)
Where could she be?,

At the store around the corner,
Or wondering at night,
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking,

Calling all my friends all around the place,
Guy, Laverette, or my homey Rob Base,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me,
Yo, Veo on the phone,

Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover,
Fab Five, homey won't you help a young brother,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind,

The thought is so clear of the love I need here,
Like Houdini be magic, and why don't you appear,
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face,

I'm seeing her face, again and again,
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in,
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?,
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love,

Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?,
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ,
(Have you seen her? tell me have you seen her? have you seen her?)

To the love I know
I'm ready and willing
Getting out of control
You win and you lose some
But if you stay in the game
Before you know it
You'll feel the fire
But don't get burned by the flame
You'll find the answer any day
With every beat of my heart
I keep getting closer to you
With every beat of my heart now
I know we're getting closer
To love with every beat
I just wanna know you
More every day
And now it won't be long
Till I hear you say (say it, say it)
Say that you do boy
It's just a matter of time
Before you know it
You'll feel the fire
And it's burning deep inside
You'll find the answer
In his eyes
With every beat of my heart
I keep getting closer to you
With every beat of my heart now
I know we're getting closer to love
With every beat of my heart
I feel you moving closer to me, oh

@@@
Woah, yeah
Do do do, oh

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

Do, do, do, oh
Mmm, woah yeah

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find
That what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for

It's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time
Woah yeah

We never talked about it but I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry,
But I wouldn't want to waste your time
'Cause I love you, but I can't take anymore
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
If we could try like we tried before
Would you keep on telling me those lies?
Do you remember?

There seemed no way to make up,
'Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me,
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side,
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go
Do you remember?

Through all of my life,
In spite of all the pain
You know that people are funny sometimes,
'Cause they just can't wait to get hurt again,
Tell me do you remember?

There are things we won't recall,
And feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it,
'Cause we never seemed to have the time
There was always something more important to do,
More important to say
But "I love you" wasn't one of those things,
And now it's too late
Do you remember?

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that now you know wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let them know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much

Yo, I told you (You can't touch this)
Why you standing there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell school is in, sucker (You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Making no sweat that's what I'm giving 'em
Now they know
You talk about the Hammer when you're talking 'bout a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it's gonna take in the nineties to burn
The charts legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (You can't touch this)

Stop! Hammer time!

Go with the flow it is said
If you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump

Bump, bump, bump
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong, but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

You're so together, boy, but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Schemin', plannin' lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep

(Don't you tell yourself)That it's okay
(Sick and tired of)All of your games
(And you want me to stay)Ah, better change
(Makes no sense to me)Your crazy ways

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of livin' such a dangerous life, hoo
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Not afraid to die

Babyface and L.A. Reid

Last night, I had the time of my life--
it's true
For last night, I made love for the very
first time
With you

I never knew love could be so sweet
It never made a difference to me
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you made the difference
Now love is so clear

And I can't stop (Can't stop)**
How I feel
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we
And Oh I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me

Last night, you bought something special
out of me
And for the first time
You made my dream a reality

I never though love was meant for me
For Iwas blind and could not see
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the
difference
Now love is so sincere

Repeat chorus ** 4x

You've got me thinking that I need
protection
Cause your love is so strong
I don't wanna do wrong
Girl your love seems like it's true
protection
You just give me a call
And I'll give you my all

Repeat Chorus

All right!
Stop whatcha doin'
'cause I'm about to ruin
the image and the style that ya used to.
I look funny,
but yo I'm makin' money, see
so yo world I hope you're ready for me.
Now gather round
I'm the new fool in town
and my sound's laid down by the Underground.
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
so just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty.
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee.
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee.
I'm steppin' tall, y'all,
and just like Humpty Dumpty
you're gonna fall when the stereos pump me.
I like to rhyme,
I like my beats funky,
I'm spunky.  I like my oatmeal lumpy.
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat.
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy.
Allow me to amaze thee.
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
and I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say "Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin"
that's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
but ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B,
all the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
and now I'm gonna do my dance.

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
jig around, shakin' ya rump,
and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump.

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stupid!

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world,
keep on doin' the Humpty Dance,
and to the ladies,
peace and humptiness forever

It takes two hearts to share

Your eyes will always see through me,

Never dream of givin' up

Forgive me when I get it wrong,
Sometimes it's hard to be that strong
And oh, I would do anything
For you I'd turn the stars around,
I'd find a way somehow

This time, you'll see I built a bridge to you again
Love shines, we'll sweep away the past
We're more than lovers, more than friends

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried that called my name
And when you needed me, I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time, you were there for me

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you, ho-whoa-ho

We spent the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said, "I love you, babe," without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
And through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you

We've had our share of hard times, but that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

Oh, woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
Oh my darling, I love you

Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you

Pump it, stomp it, jam, trip on this!

Get up, get up, get busy do it
Get up and move that body
Get up people now get down to it (before the night is over)
Get up, get up, get busy do it
I wanna see you party
Get up people now get down to it (before the night is over)

Here we are
Face to face
We forget, time and place
Hold me now
Don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know why
The time we spend together's gonna fly
And everything you do to me
Is gonna feel so right
Baby when you're loving me
I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you

Here we are
All alone
Trembling hearts, beating strong
Reaching out, a breathless kiss
I never thought could feel like this
I want to stop the time from passing by
I wanna close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me
I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you

(Bridge)
There's nothing I can do
I'm helpless in your arms
Oh baby what you do
I'm in love, this is it
There's no turning back this time
No no no
Here we are
Once again
But this time we're only friends
Funny world
Sometimes lies
Become the game, when love's the prize
And though no one knows what's going on inside
And all the love I feel for you
Is something I should hide
When I have you close to me
The feeling's so sublime
That there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
No, no, no, Can't keep from loving you baby no, no, no

Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet

You want it all, but you can't have it

It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it

You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad, it happened, and it's a shame

You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it

Couldn't see that I was blind

All or nothing, push, it's got to be.
Something's gotta show when you're livin' under heat.
All or nothing, push, girl, let it be.
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat.
I'm under heat oh baby, please take it slow.
Give me some time and maybe, our love will grow.
I want to suit you baby and make it right.
Take it from me babe, I wanna rock all night.
If it's good for me, it's good for you.
You gotta never let your mood get dry.
Just keep it wet and my seven forty jet

I want the best
I won't settle for less
Since Cupid shot my heart
I'm stressed

The love I feel is real strong
I can't prolong
Drop the beat and let's do this

I can't believe the way
I fell in love with you, girl
You caught me by surprise

A dream come true
It was you
I didn't even know your name
Oh, no

Now you've got me thinking
Bout you every single day, girl
I can't get you off my mind

Cupid shot his arrow in my heart
And I'm not the same, no, no

Just like a fairytale
I would sail oceans blue
To get to you
Valentine, please be mine
I want you, girl

(CHORUS)
I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) of these
Feelings in my heart
I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) of these
Feelings in my heart

I like the way you give me
Your affection every night, girl
You really turn me on

It makes my day when you say
You're never gonna let me go
Oh, no

Now everything around me
Just reminds me more of you, girl
I miss you when you're gone

Cupid shot his arrow in my heart
And there's something
You should know
You should know, know, know

Just like a movie screen
A love scene of me and you
The things we do
Casanova, move over
I want you, girl

(CHORUS)

I'll be your Romeo
I love you so, I can't let go
(I can't let go) no, no, no

Hello, fly girl
How you doing
It's Dr.Ice and Dino
With the love just for you

And hey, I'm coming
Right and exact
Gonna be your romeo
To state a fact

? to express
How I feel about you

Don't move slow
Just kinda go with the flow
And let your hair down low
For me, your Romeo

I'll be your Romeo
I really love you so
I'll never let you go

Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife
I feel like I'm in the prime of my life

Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast
I don't know how long this feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight

Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know how much more I got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill

Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will

Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

No, I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling, I don't know why I go to extremes

I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
Out of the darkness, into the light

Somebody told me
There'd be trouble at home
'Cause we never talk a lot
When we spend time alone
So how are we supposed to know
Know when something is wrong
Well, we've got a right to communicate
It keeps a happy home

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me

When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can't wait 'til we get home
'Cause we got a way of talking
And it's better than words
It's the strangest kind of relationship
Oh, but with us it always works

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

Whatever you want
It's alright with me
'Cause you've got that whip appeal
So work it on me
It's better than love
Sweet as can be
You've got that whip appeal
So whip it on me

Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me
Keep on whippin' on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me

And no one does it like me

This a very serious message, so all of you...please listen.

There are some people living in this world,
They have no food to eat,
They have no place to go.

But we all are God's children,
We have to learn to love one another,
Just remember they could be us,
Remember we all are brothers.

I'm not tryin' to darken up your day,
But help others in need,
Show them there's a better way.

This one's for the children,
The children of the world.
This one's for the children,
May God keep them in his world.

Many people are happy,
And many people are sad.
Some people have many things,
That others can only wish they had.

So for the sake of the children,
Show them love's the only way to go,
'Cause they're our tomorrow,
And people they've got to know.

I'm not tryin' to darken up your day,
But help others in need,
And show them there's a better way.

This ones for the children,
The children of the world.
This one's for the children,
May God keep them in his world.

This one's, for the children
Only for the children
The children of the world
This one's, for the children
This one's, for the children

Many people are happy,
Many people are sad,
This one's for the children of the world
The children of the world.

Oh yeah

There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises
I guess they don't mean a thing

So baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away

We used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go, yeah

Girl, before I met you
I was F-I-N-E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah, my heart's been doin' time

Spent me up like money
Then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

Guitar

Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah yeah yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much
Tell me you were lyin' when you cried for me

Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was good
In your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice, no no no
'Cause I don't wanna burn in paradise

Ooh
I don't, I don't
I don't wanna wanna burn in paradise
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't wanna burn, I don't wanna burn
Now no, no no no, ahhh

Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Ahh

Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

I gotta tell you what I'm feeling inside
I could lie to myself but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes
Girl, I'm out of my head over you

I lived so long believing all love is blind
But everything about you
Is telling me this time

It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be loving you forever

I hear the echo of the promise I made
When you're strong you can stand on your own
But those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't wanna go it alone

And I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you
Is telling me this time

It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be loving you forever, yeah

Oh, I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive
'Cause I lived my life believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time

It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be loving you forever

Oh, it's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be loving you forever

Yeah

I got real bored on a friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do.
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW.
I drove to the party and I pimped on in, just to see what I could see.
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for, I was lookin' for some company.

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar. She looked kinda all alone.
So I pimped on over and I asked her name. The child was bad to the bone.
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek. The only kind of rap it takes.
She knew I was bad when I pulled out a leash, she said "How much money you make?"

Jerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.
Jerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.

I took her to my crib and I tied her up. I figured that's what she liked.
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell, it didn't matter to me. - She was white.
I said "How come people in your neighborhood, don't like it when a brother's rich?
Ain't my blood the same color as yours? Answer that question, bitch!"

It just pisses you off to see me drivin' that fancy car, don't it?
Bet you'd rather see me drivin' one of those ester grate ones.
Like the one your daddy drives, wouldn't you?
Let me tell you one thing. That's dead!
About as dead as you'll be if you don't rearrange your brain.
Catch my drift. Turn it up!

Oh, nasty me!

Girl, you think you wanna turn it up? Where's my checkbook?
That's right, check it out. An awful lot of O's, wouldn't you say?

Hit it. Cross over, uh!
Turn it up.

Jerk out, jerkin' everything in sight.
Jerk out, got to make some love tonight.

Jerk out.
Don't cha all just hate it, when we walk into y'all's joint?
And just jerk out everything in sight?
Don't it make you mad?
Jerk out - Don't it make you mad?
Jerk out - It'd make me mad!

Everybody in the house say "Jerk out" - Jerk out!
"Ow!" - Ow!
Say "Jerk out" - Jerk out!
"Ow!" - Ow!
Everybody say "Jerk out" - Jerk out!
"Ow!" - Ow!
Everybody say "Jerk out" - Jerk out!
"Ow!" - Ow!

People, let me turn it up. Which coat should I wear tonight?
If you think I'm vain, you're right.
Look out, somebody say "Vanity" - Vanity!
"Jerk out" - Jerk out!
"Ow!" - Ow!

Everybody jerk out and do it right.
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out.
Oh Lawd, hey yeah. Got to make some love to night.
I'm master of the jerk out, oh Lawd. Jerkin' everything in sight.
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out, oh Lawd. Got to make some love tonight.

Turn it up, uh! Jerk out, oh yeah! Jerkin' everything in sight.
Wait a minute, talkin' 'bout the jerk out. Jerkin' everything in sight.
Jerk out. Jerkin' everything in sight.
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out, oh Lawd. Got to make...
I got to make a little love tonight.
Jerk out!

Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love, she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, 'Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof'
I asked her her name, she said 'blah-blah-blah'
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, 'How do you like the show?'
She said, 'I was very amused'
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, 'Do ya have a man?' she tried to pretend
She said, 'No I don't, I only have a friend'
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, and then I called again
I said, 'Yo, who was that?' 'Oh, he's just a friend'
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
'Yo, could you tell me where is door three?'
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth,
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend
Ayyy boi

I always love a little mystery
But now the tensions killing me
No place left for words to hide
I never thought it could be quite so tough
Lips once sealed are splitting up
There ain't no secrets to outshine, father time

Whispers in the dark don't do, let's hit the lights
Now I just got to spread the news
So what are you telling me? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me? What are you telling me?

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I don't have any ifs, I am positive
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Were never gonna be alone, our love is stone

Too many words are too much a crowd
I wanna spill 'em or they'll leak out
I'm so glad to get the chance
I kept it secret till I knew for sure
So not to pick my heart off the floor
Now it's time to take a stand, heart in hand

Whispers in the dark don't do, let's hit the lights
Now I just got to spread the news
So what are you telling me? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me? What are you telling me?

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
When I drop a tear you are always here
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I'm look at a living dream, don't wake me up

Don't stop, love me till you drop, it's alright with me
One sharp arrow through the heart, it's alright, it's alright
Now whistle

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I will never give you up
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
You're my one and only love

Whispers in the dark don't do, let's hit the lights
Now I just got to spread the news
So what are you telling me now? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me, now?

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I wanna tell the everybody you're my cup of tea
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Your love never shakes, you don't alternate

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Smoke gets in my eyes, I don't see other guys
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Our love will never tumble down, it's built on solid ground

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There's thieves in the temple tonight
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
They're thieves in the temple tonight

Love, if you're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I should die if you're not there

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
They're thieves in the temple tonight

Feel like I'm looking for my soul
Like a poor man looking for gold
They're thieves in the temple tonight

Voices from the sky say
Rely on your best friend to pull you through
Even if I wanted to
I couldn't really truly
Because my only friend is you

Ooh ooh ooh ooohh
Come on

They're thieves in the temple tonight
Kicking me in my heart
Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart
Because me and you could've been a work of art
Thieves in the temple

Baby don't you know I'm holding on the best that I can
Love please help me be a better man
Better than the thieves in the temple tonight, in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple tonight (hurt me)

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
They're thieves in the temple tonight
Thieves in the temple ohhh
"You said you loved me!"
(Thieves in the temple)
"You said I was your man!"
(Thieves in the temple)
(Love come quick)
"But they were lies! Lies!"
(Love come in a hurry)
Thieves in the temple tonight
"Ahhhh!"
