Wake up in the morning, feelin' like P. Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
Now, now, we goin' till they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Now the party don't start till I walk in

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop

Picture perfect memories, scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone, 'cause I can't fight it any more
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
I just need you now

Oh, baby, I need you now

Hey, hey, hey

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget ya
And so I went and let you blow my mind

Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, hey, hey

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny

I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you; like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
You so gangster; I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me

Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey.

Katy Perry
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh

California girls, we're unforgettable (California)
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle (ooh)
Oooh oh oooh

California girls (California), we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast), now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Snoop Dogg
Toned, tan, fit, and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most

I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah)

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Katy my lady (yeah)
You looking here baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (oh yeah)

Katy Perry
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh (c'mon, c'mon)

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast, West Coast), now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh (ey, ey)

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion

And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back

But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
And they sayin' "What would you wish for?"
If you had one chance

So airplane, airplane
Sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank

Yeah back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Then maybe yo maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?

So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Hayley Williams
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

I-I-I could really use a wish right now

7@Eminem feat. Rihanna@Love The Way You Lie
@@@
Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped "who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

On a carousel so around I spun(spun)

With no direction just tryna get some(some?)
Tryna chase skirts living in the summer sun(sun?)
And so I lost more than I had ever won(wha)
And honestly I ended up with none(huh)

It's so much nonsense it's on my conscience
I'm thinking maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering

If there was something that you wanna know(that you wanna know)
But nevermind that we should let it go(we should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode(TV episode)

Lil Wayne
She got that good good
She Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, for her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go, but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth, soccer team
Cold as a winter's day
Hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves
Steal your love and leave

Gudda Gudda
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I let you be the judge, n-n-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda
I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't even wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga
Grocery bag

Ooh, baby

He say I'm bad, he probably right

I'm so pretty, like
Be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch
Be on my egg whites
He say "Nicki, don't stop. You the bestest"
And I just be coming off the top, asbestos

Drake
I love ya sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I'll race for your love
Shake and bake, Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W., but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen 'em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear; you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was yo' girl?
I thought I recognized her

(Chorus)

Tyga
She like tanning
I like staying in
She like romancing
I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in
I think her conscience is
She watching that Oxygen
I'm watching ESPN
But when that show end
She all on my skin
Lotion
Slow emotions
Roller coasting
Like back forth, hold it (Hold it)
She pose like it's for posters
And I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me
She said "Don't you ever show this"
I'm too loyal
And too focused
To be losing
And be hopeless
When I spoke this
She rejoiced it
Said "Your words get me open"
So I closed it
Where your clothes is
I'm only lovin' for the moment

Jae Millz
Uh
She ain't got a man
But she's not alone

Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

(K-kinda busy) K-kinda busy

(K-kinda busy) Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You shoulda made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop telephonin' me (Stop telephonin' me)

Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bub'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call when you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bub'

Beyonce:
Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I shoulda left my phone at home, 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector, Sorry, I cannot answer

Lady GaGa:
Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone ri-ringing

Beyonce:
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station (Station...)
Tonight, I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin' (Tonight, I'm dancin')

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kind of heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece: I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire

Travie McCoy
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here lady, have this."
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Bruno Mars
Oh, every time I close my eyes
What you see? What you see, bro?
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?
A different city every night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For what?
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh

Travie McCoy
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

Bruno Mars
I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
So bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Buy everything
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
What up, Oprah! Ha ha!

Oh, every time I close my eyes
What you see? What you see, bro?
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?
A different city every night
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)(Yeah)to take a stand (to take a stand)(It's been a ride)
Everybody(I guess I had to)(everybody), come take my hand(Go to that place)(come take my hand)(To get to this one)
We'll walk this road together(Now some of you)through the storm
Whatever weather(Might still be in that place)cold or warm(If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone(Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like(I'll get you there)you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
FromInfinitedown to the lastRelapsealbum, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid(I'm not afraid)to take a stand(to take a stand)
Everybody(everybody), come take my hand(come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid(I'm not afraid)to take a stand(to take a stand)
Everybody(everybody), come take my hand(come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid(I'm not afraid)to take a stand(to take a stand)
Everybody(everybody), come take my hand(come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams

I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hit my head against the wall

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

CHORUS:
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mom's telling me I should think twice
But love to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My esteem is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack-head

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
(All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

So I got a question:
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love, huh your drug?
Your drug, huh your drug
Huh your drug, is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Hey! Hey!
So...
Your love, your love
Your love, your love...

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(They said farewell)

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(A jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly

I know that we are young,
And I know that you may love me,
But I just can't be with you like this anymore,
Alejandro.

She's got both hands, in her pocket,
And she won't look at you, won't look at you.
She hides true love, en su bolsillo,
She's got a halo around her finger, around you.

You know that I love you, boy,
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I've gotta choose,
Nothing to lose.

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro.
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando.
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch,
Just smoke my cigarette and hush.
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto.

Alejandro, Alejandro.
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro.

Stop, please, just let me go,

She's not broken, she's just a baby,
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like a dad.
And all those flames that burned before him,
Now, he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad.

You know that I love you, boy,
Hot like Mexico, rejoice.
At this point I've gotta choose,
Nothing to lose.

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro.

Don't bother me, don't bother me. (Alejandro)
Don't call my name, don't call my name. (Bye, Fernando)

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, Fernando.

Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So I traveled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realized, yeah, it was only just a dream

I was at the top, and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear, now I can't take it
Knowin' somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I shoulda' put it down, shoulda' got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair

My lover, my life
My shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I know that it just ain't right

I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So I traveled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realized, yeah, it was only just a dream

When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryin' to get myUsheron, but I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinkin' all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

And I was thinkin' 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me
Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gon' be
Opened my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So, I traveled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realized, yeah, it was only just a dream

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything
I said, if you ever loved somebody put your hands up

She could go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up!
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby, pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get wit ya chick just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib
Then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar wit a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big
There's just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)

I be like Nick-nac-paddywac
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it takes till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home
I could make me show stop
Soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really gettin low then Ima shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel
But when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well
Asian persuasion
No discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butterican pecan peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces
'Cause I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big
Well there just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? (x8)
Go low, (Go low) lower than you know (x4)

Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop (Get it, get it)
Put it on reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you workin wit
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yea you a superstar there's just one thing I gotta know so

I've been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet!
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not goin' in!
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap!
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet!

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!

I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead!
Do, do, do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt
There're certain things that should be left unsaid!
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh baby, your time is runnin' out!
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud!
All you do is fill me up with doubt!

This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof!

This time I'll be bulletproof

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we would never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh

I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh

And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like

Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Make it last
Hold on
Never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)

(Oh yeah)
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
Yes, yes we're gonna make it now (hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it (come on, come on)
I can see it now

Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say "I love you," enough
'Till it's too late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would've done?

(Chorus)
Yeah, we gotta stop
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given if
This is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that
Every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or throw it all away
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying

And if you plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
So when we long for absolution, there'll be no one on the line

(Chorus)

Like we're dying (x4)

(Chorus)

You never know a good thing 'til it's gone
You never see a crash 'til its head on
Why we think we're right when we're dead wrong,
You never know a good thing till it's gone

(Chorus)

Like we're dying (x4)

All the right friends in all the right places, so yeah, we're goin' down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down

Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They got it better than what anyone's told you
They'll be the King of Hearts, and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers

I know we got it good, but they got it made
And their grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up, but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowin' our name

They got
All the right friends in all the right places, so yeah, we're goin' down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down

Do you think I'm special?
Do you think I'm nice, am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear, and the sound you like
Are we just sinking in a ocean of faces?
It can't be possible that rain could fall
Only when it's over our heads
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away
Over their world instead, they got, they got

All the right friends in all the right places, so yeah, we're goin' down
They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're goin', yeah, we're goin' down

It don't matter what you see, I know I could never be
Someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say, I know I could never fake
Someone that could sound like you

All the right friends in all the right places, (so yeah, we're goin' down)
All the right moves and all the right faces, (so yeah, we're goin' down)
All the right friends in all the right places, (so yeah, we're goin' down)

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know

You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they...

When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive,
Looking for something wild

And now we looking like pimps
In my Gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on,
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious.
Tear it down,
'Til the sun comes back around

And now we looking so smash
Knocking over trash cans
E'rybody breaking bottles
It's a filthy hot-mess
I'm down to get payed.
I'm not the designated driver so
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't
Oh!

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around

Who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember at all

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah that's right
I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright bottles on me, long as imma drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language... Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known

'Bout to go Thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need is a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good Smir-do', a package of the Swishers
I did overnight, it couldn't have happened any quicker

Y'all know them? Well fuck it me either
Point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it
Throwin' hundreds when I should be throwin' ones
Bitch I run it

And this is what imma do until it's over
Till it's over, but it's far from over

[Verse 2]
One thing about music when it hit you feel no pain
I swear I got that shit that make theses bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that
It's just game
It's just what comes with the fame

And I'm ready for that I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain
Everything is Kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer

But I probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your widescreen on
And if you thinkin' imma quit before I die, dream on

They treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it who you kiddin'?
Nobody's ever done it like I did it

I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year

Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic

These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy

I'll have you time travelin', have your mind babblin'
People tryna inherit the skill so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes, and
I see Mindfreak like, "What's up man, what's happenin'?"

So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I've never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9

Well take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pidda-dow-dow

See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia

I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
I do this every day, hocus pocus is my steelo

I've got the magic in me(I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold(Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me(I got the magic, baby)

You ain't gon' Tie Me Down.

[Verse 1: ~Legacy~]
You know we been together for a minute
But a, it's kinda been forever since we been in
The kinda situation not involvin' other women
& it's pretty obvious that your kinda trippin' like
"Who the hell is this bitch lookin' a hot mess
What you fell for this chick"
You know we got problems & you failed to fix it
I'm like "You need to go somewhere else with this shit
'Cause I ain't gon' put up with you
Talkin' 'about how she make you uncomfortable
I mean, shit I'm only 17
& um, a perfect couples only in a dream
& right now I'm pretty much away for this relationship
I think we should wait for it
I mean later we can try things out
But not right now.

[Chorus: ~Ray J.~]
'Cause She ain't gon' Tie Me Down.
Why you on the road?
Buyin' all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now
I think you need to close yo' mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' Tie Me Down, Tie Me Down, Tie Me Down
You ain't gon' Tie Me Down.

[Verse 2: ~Ben J~]
Ha, Ha.
Aye girl waddup?
No I'm not gon' make a scene
Buh you can't tie me down like a pair of shoe strings
Yeah you cute, so what
But let's get it through your head
Yeah we make love, sex weed all in the bed
It's the best & I love her but things don't change
When I'm not faithful you be feelin' my pain
Now you stuck like a stain & I can't believe that
Baby girl 100, I ain't tryin' to do that
Got too many girls & I ain't lettin' go
'Cause my life is great & you ain't nothin' but a hoe
Yeah you come to my shows & you very supportive
Just showed me a camera & my show recorded
It was nice, I'm surprised that you still standin' here
As you know I'm a man & I have no feelings
I'm a start from the top, girl this ain't no lovin'
I'm a New Boy, girl so.

[Chorus: ~Ray J.~]
She ain't gon' Tie Me Down.
Why you on the road?
Buyin' all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now
I think you need to close yo' mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' Tie Me Down, Tie Me Down, Tie Me Down
You ain't gon' Tie Me Down.

[Ray J:]
Baby it's not that time
No you just can't Tie Me Down.

Today is not the day
It ain't not okay
Never gonna tie me, tie me
Never ever Tie Me Down.

[Chorus: ~Ray J.~]
'Cause She ain't gon' Tie Me Down.
Why you by the road?
You can buy all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
That's you want right now
But I'm like naw
I think you need to close yo' mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' Tie Me Down, Tie Me Down, Tie Me Down
You ain't gon' Tie Me Down.

You ain't gon' Tie Me Down.
You ain't gon' Tie Me Down.
You ain't gon' Tie Me Down.

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Uh... uh, yo...
He the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym,
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

Anyway, I think I met him sometime before,
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve,
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him,
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me "Mama", "Lil' Mama", I call him "Baby"...

Mm-hmm... yo... yo...
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam...
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam;
I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland...

Anyway, I think I met him in the sky;
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface andRaekwon...
Konvict! Just likeAkon,
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the Jake-on...

Find me in your heart - I'm in need of your love...

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess, whoa
Am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in a cab
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right
And I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin'
And I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio

And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

I put my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.

Get to the club in my taxicab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She's gotta be from outta town"

So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin'
And I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune

And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

Got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.

Feel like hopping on a flight
Back to my hometown tonight
Something stops me every time
The DJ plays my song and I feel all right

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
And the butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

Got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.

So I put my hands up

All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin but a vulture
Always hopin for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Ohohohohohohohoh... [x2]
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)

I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm bout to throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces) [x2]

Tyga
Uh, Use to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care but I ain't get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind
Fuck it let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when it's all said and done,
I ain't gon be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin
My heart big but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin
Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, whatchu trippin for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus:]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces) [x2]

Kevin McCall
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complain
Shemake wanna leave the one I'm withUsher Raymond
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, She give me deja vu
And all that attitude, I don't care bout it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But im just puttin two up, chuckin up the deuce now

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces) [x2]

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know (I know)

And know when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Ooh impossible (yeah yeah)

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayne (ever, mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayne (ever, mayne, ever, mayne)

(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first-name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped a mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hitlist
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches

Ever, ever, Mr. West is in the buildin',
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em,
I used to have hood dreams: Big fame, big chains
I stuck my d**k inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Nah, superbad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fuckin' wasn't
"Uh, you such a fuckin' loser
You ain't even go to class, Bueller"
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'Member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom'll turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull they cameras out, and God damn, they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it back

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop, like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffer "To the top"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't want to hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last
Uh, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh, no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap'll never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes, and establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villians who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback, motherfucker, for the way that you got at me, how's it taste,
When I slap the taste out of your mouths with the bass so loud that it shakes the place?
I'm Hannibal Lector, so just in case you're thinkin' of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place (so Drake)

You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one

I remember every look upon your face,
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
And finally now, believing

Just hoping that nobody looks

Lips like licorice
Tongue like candy
Excuse me miss
But can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my lips

At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch

I said no more sailors
And no more soldiers
With your name in a heart
Tattoo upon his shoulders

Your kiss is like whiskey
It gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning
With the taste of your tongue

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my lips

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you want to cry
Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough
To let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, I'm already gone

There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

Already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

Remember all the things we wanted?
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone

I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kind of boring
Need something that I can confess

'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who drive the shiny big black cars

And everyday I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Seen it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no, so

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Got no reason
Got no shame
Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear
I'mma tell you everything

Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time
Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line

DJ Khaled!
Hey! Yeah
We the best!

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there, and they stay there
And they stay there - up down up down up down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in put yo' hands in the air, make 'em stay there!

Yeah, listen, Luda!
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down
I never went nowhere, but they sayin' "Luda's back"
Blame it on that conjure, the hood call it Luda 'gnac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down, like strippers' booties go
My verses still be servin', tight like a million virgins
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year (yeah) the South's champion (yeah)
'Cause all I do, all I - all I - all I - all I do is
Ay, woo!

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there, and they stay there
And they stay there - up down up down up down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in put yo' hands in the air, make 'em stay there!

Win, win, who? Boss
Boss, swervin' in my lo-lo
Head on the swivel, you know serving me's a no-no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger, they see it they say "oh boy"
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo'-fo'
Ask you what you laughing at - represent that mud life!
Dirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right!
We come together holdin' hands and holla "thug life"
We all strapped in all black, it's like fuck life (all we do is win!)
You riding to what (What!) 'cause we riding tonight (tonight!)
Now she riding with me 'cause you wasn't riding her right
Ross!

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there, and they stay there
And they stay there - up down up down up down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in put yo' hands in the air, make 'em stay there!

Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water gettin' boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, boss 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, "Just win baby, win!"

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there, and they stay there
And they stay there - up down up down up down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win

Opening
[Birdman]

Cash Money heroes
Private jets
Polish, fly

CHORUS
[Kevin Rudolf]
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!

Verse 1
[Kevin Rudolf]
Known from the city where no one believed in me
But I never give up the fight, yeah
But now I'm on top
I told you to let it rock (rock)
The money's fallin' from the sky-y-y-y-y
I made it

CHORUS

[Birdman]
(Yeah, YM, CMB baby, Birdman, swagged out, 100)

Verse 2
Rooftop, hella choppa burning smoke
Louie bag stay strapped wit a priceless globe
High life, flippin' and get some more
Paradise, the luxury marble floor
When I hit, hit me full of that cash
More money than I seen in a garbage can
Stunna island, money and the power
That's how we do it, make it rain, make it shower
Top floor, big timer doing big things
Over city views bought shawty new range
Flip another 100, poppin' throwing hundreds
In a new Bentley, uptown stunna

CHORUS

[Kevin Rudolf]
Ooo I made it
I made it...
I made it...
I, I, I made it...

Verse 3
[Jay Sean]
Yo ay ay ay listen
See I don't live for glamor, and I don't care for fame
I'm in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change
They didn't believe in me
Then they calling my name
Now look who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then
But ever since I done gone platinum
Everything turned around
And now the sky is falling down-nnnnn

CHORUS

Verse 4
[Lil Wayne]
Came from the gutter, lookin' like my motha'
Made it to the goal line, straight out the huddle
Cash Money goldmine, Weezy stay loyal
Boy, we getting money like we just found oil
Uh and that's word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bed rash
And I just tell em to loaf it when the bread pass
Staring at you from the top of the game man
I might drop the world, if I change hands
Uh it feel good to be here, Weezy in the building, got this bitch rebuilt
Young Money

CHORUS

[Jay Sean]
I look to the skyyy!!

Ooo!
Made it, I made it
Yes, I did

MMMM better...MMMM better...

No one that can make me feel sooo goooood
How did we stay so long together?
When everybody, everybody said we never would
And just when I, I start to think they're right
That love has died...

Chorus:
There you go making my heart beat again,
heart beat again,

There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in,

Whutooo whutooo
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue

Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right, fight about it all night
Had enough
You give me that look
"I'm sorry baby let's make up"
You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that...

Chorus:
There you go making my heart beat again,

You took me by the hand
And you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make
Everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense
Till the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Fell in love when I saw you standin' there

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there

still you were lonely,
we coulda worked it out,

uhh, but i guess things change,
its funny how someone else's success brings pain,
when ya no longer involved that person has it all,
and you just stuck standing there,

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,
I'm gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,

[Timbaland]
Yeah,
ever since I've been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
your life is good but me and you it's catastrophe,
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed,
if I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
the more money I made you acting like my enemy,
its crazy, I can't help it if you feel ashamed,
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
how can something so familiar be so strange,
closest friends get estranged when the status change,
ahh, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
and my whole wild ... is the only one that had my back,
you were the perfect girl, now it seems we don't match,
is it the money, want me to give it back,

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
to a condo downtown because its all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life,
you shoulda been here to kick it with me,

we coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
but now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy,
killing shit the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
how I go from being the man that you argue with,
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
but I'm addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
'cause whats a star when its most important fan is missing?

To wrap your arms around me for real

You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad

Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always going to be the same
Oh, no, you'll never change

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it

Who else really tryna fuck with Hollywood Cole? I'm with Marley G, bro
Flying Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you prolly should know
This that Slumdog Millionaire Bollywood flow
And uh, my real friends never hearin' from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sippin', so this shit is movin' kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Lil Wayne

And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes, I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin' plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin' where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killa, but don't push me

Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more off my second leg
Ma'fuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
No-now, c'mon, be my blood donor
Flo' so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big, and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled out? From where they make gumbo at
Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack
But you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga, nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

I know they say you can't go home again.
I just had to come back one last time.
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam.
But these handprints on the front steps are mine.
And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar.
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
my favorite dog is buried in the yard.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here its like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself
if I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
from the house that built me.

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years.
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines.
Plans were drawn, concrete poured,
and nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here its like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
from the house that built me.


You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can.
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here its like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
from the house that built me.

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh, oh oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, you know
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep them in your pocket
Save them for a time when your really gonna need them, oh

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls

93@Paramore@The Only Exception
@@@
When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist, but darling

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Well, maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing

She grew up on a side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good
She grew up slow
Like American honey

Steady as a preacher
Free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin'
But wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Get caught in the race
Of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yea

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey

Ooh There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin's sweeter than summertime

Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside

So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by

You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked

So let me thank you for your time
And try not to waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast

I hate to break it you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

Oh...

You sound so innocent
All full of good intent
You swear you know best

But you expect me to
Jump up on board with you and ride off into your delusional sunset

I'm not the one who's lost
With no direction, oh
But you'll ever see

You're so busy makin' maps
With my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died
And made you king of anything?

All my life
I've tried
To make everybody happy while I
Just hurt
And hide
Waitin' for someone to tell me it's my turn
To decide

Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)
Oh (oh oh oh)

Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be

Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong but you already know
Believe me I won't stop at nothin'
To see you so I've started runnin'

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time
Oh why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you
