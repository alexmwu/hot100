(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories
Of the lonesome times

(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterdays(dreams of yesterdays)

Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories
All the lonesome time

(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my live
In dreams of yesterdays

(Those happy hours)Those happy hours
(That we once knew)That we once knew
(Though long ago)Though long ago
(Still make me blue)Still make me blue

(They say that time)They say that time
(Heals a broken heart)Heals a broken heart
(But time has stood still)Time has stood still
(Since we've been apart)Since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I said I've made up my mind
To live in memories
All the lonesome time
Sing the song, children

It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
Of dreams of yesterdays(of yesterdays)

(Roses are red, my love)
(Doo doo da doo)

A long, long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way:

"Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you."

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name:

"Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you."(as sweet as you)

Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter, dear
And I wrote back to you:

"Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But luck may God bless you."(may God bless you)

Is that your little girl?
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too:

"Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you."
(Roses are red)

A swingin' place called palisades park
To have some fun and see what I could see
That's where the girls are

I took a ride on a shoot-the-chute
That girl I sat beside was awful cute
After we stopped she was holdin' hands with me
My heart was flyin'

Up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Back like a loop-the-loop
And around like a merry-go-round

We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
When you stop at the top of a ferris wheel
When I fell in love down at palisades park

(Don't break the heart that loves you so)

Don't break the heart that loves you
Handle it with care
Don't break the heart that needs you
Darling, please be fair

Why do you flirt and constantly hurt me?
Why do you treat our love so carelessly?

You know I'm jealous of you
And yet you seem to try
To go out of your way
To be unkind

Sweetheart, I'm begging of you
Don't break this heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine

Darling, please don't hurt me
Please, don't make me cry
I don't know what I'd do if you'd ever say goodbye
Remember, I love you so much
And love is life's greatest joy
Please don't break my heart like a child breaks a little toy

Sweetheart, I'm begging of you
Don't break this heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine

That's known as the twist

On a go-go dance
Believing I'd find
Me some romance

And this old lady
I happened to see
I said, come on, baby
Do the twist with me

Dance from now until dawn
She said, thank you, baby

I said, now the rhythm
Is getting real sweet
This is no time to
Slow up your feet

You better come home Speedy Gonzales, away from tannery row.

Pull a funny as you went out the door

And I'd wave goodbye as you go.

Till you walked with your *grip* through the door.

You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes

Rain drops fallin' from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Some day when my cryin's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll
Never see me complain

Let me tell you 'bout Ahab The Arab
The Sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just dripping off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hands

He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And every evening about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde...and ride

Spoken

Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils, swingingest grade "A" number one U.S. choice dancer in the Sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had a thing going. You know, and they'd been carrying on for some time now behind the Sultan's back and you could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert air and he'd say (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, "stop, Clyde!" and Clyde would say, (imitate camel voice). Which is camel for, "What the heck did he say anyway?"
Well....

He brought that camel to a screeching halt
At the rear of Fatima's tent jumped off Clyde,
Snuck around the corner and into the tent he went
There he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug
Wearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
And a bone in her nose ho, ho.
Spoken

There she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty. Eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate, bowl of chitterlings, two bananas, three Hershey bars, sipping on a "R C" Co-Cola listening to her transistor, watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung, "Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?" and Ahab walked up to her and he said, (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, "Let's twist again like we did last summer, baby." (laughter) You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug, give him one of the sly looks, she said, (coy, girlish laugh) "Crazy baby".
'Round and around and around and around...etc.

When Liberty Valance rode to town, the womenfolk would hide, they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around, the men would step aside
'Cause the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shootin' straight and fast, he was mighty good

From out of the east a stranger came, a law book in his hand, a man
The kind of a man the West would need to tame a troubled land
'Cause the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shootin' straight and fast, he was mighty good

Many a man would face his gun, and many a man would fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The love of a girl can make a man stay on when he should go, stay on
Just tryin' to build a peaceful life where love is free to grow
But the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood
When the final showdown came at last, a law book was no good

Alone and afraid, she prayed that he'd return that fateful night, aw, that night
When nothin' she said could keep her man from goin' out to fight
From the moment a girl gets to be full-grown, the very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other, only one returns

Everyone heard two shots ring out, one shot made Liberty fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance

Snap your fingers
I'll come running back to you, hmm
On bended knees
I said snap your fingers, I'll come running
I'll be true, take a chance on me
The lights turn green
Baby I gotta know, should I stay or go
Let me love you like a lover
Oh you use to know
Turn the key and let me in
Hmm through that same old door

I had it but I lost it
Now I've got a broken heart to mend
I don't care what the cost is
I gotta find a way back in
Snap your fingers,

When she kissed me I was born and she said goodbye
And I knew right away I was born to cry
Now I'm happy and the joke's on her
Cause I found that place for lover's who wander

She took my love, said she's not comin back
So my world and my sky was all turnin black
Now I see the light, I'm wise to her
Cause I found that place for lovers who wander

A walkin around thinkin about her
Never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it

Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
My dreams have gone for her
Cause I found that place for lover's who wander

Wo wo wo yeah, she took my love you see
Yeah, she doesn't bother me
Yeah I found that place to be
Yeah, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

You beat me to the punch, that time
You beat me to the punch oh,oh,oh,oh
You beat  me to the punch

Whoa, after I hadn't known you for it seemed like a long,long time
I wanted,wanted to ask you would you please,please be mine
Whenever you came around,my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours
You beat me to the punch one more time
You beat me to the punch oh,oh,oh,oh
You beat me to the punch, yeah

Since I love you I thought you would be true
And love me tender, so I let my heart surrender
To you, yes I did
But I found out beyond a doubt one day boy,you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me blue
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day
And beat you to the punch

(Words and music by Crofford)

How old was I when I first seen old Rivers?
I can't remember when he weren't around
Well, that old fellow did a heap of work
Spent his whole life walking plowed ground.

He had a one-room shack not far from us
And well, we was about as poor as him
He had one old mule he called Midnight
And I'd trailed along after them.

He used to plow them rows straight and deep
And I'd come along near behind
A-bustin' up clods with my own bare feet
Old Rivers was a friend of mine.

That sun'd get high and that mule would work
Till old Rivers'd say,Whoa!
He'd wipe his brow, lean back on the reins
And talk about a place he was gonna go.

Chorus:
He'd say, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there amoung the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow.

--- Instrumental ---

I got a letter today from the folks back home and
They're all fine and crops is dry
Down at the end my mama said,Son
You know old Rivers died.

Just sittin' here now on this new-plowed earth
Trying to find me a little shade
With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule, old Rivers and me.

Chorus:
Now, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there amoung the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow.

With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule, old Rivers and me...

In '43 they Set to sea
13 men and Kennedy
Aboard the PT 109
To fight the Brazen enemy
On the isle of ol lusana
In the strait beyond nehru
A Jap deatroyer in the night
Cut the '109 in two.

CHORUS:
Smokin fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

On the coast, commanderos, lookin thru this periscope
Australian niven saw the battle
For the crew had little hope
Two were dead, some were wounded, all were clinging to the bow
Fightin fire, fightin water, trying to save their lives somehow.

CHORUS:
Smokin fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen Gods of old Japan
Yeah, the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

Mac Me hun, the irishman, was burned so badly he couldn't swim
Leave me here, go on he said, cause if you don't we'll all be dead
The PT's skipper wouldn't leave him, a man to die alone at sea
With his strap, between his teeth, he towed the irishman to the sea.

CHORUS:
Smokin fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
They thought they had the best of a mighty good man

He led his men thru water's Dark
Rocky reefs and hungry skarks
Braved the enemy's bayonets
A .38 around his neck
4 more days, 4 more nights,
A recue boat pulled into sight
The PT 109 was gone,
But Kennedy and his crew lived on

So who could Guess, and who could possibly know
That this same man named Kennedy, would,
Be the leader of a nation,
Be the one to take command,
The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again,

Smokin fire upon the sea,
Everywhere they looked was the enemy,
But JFK and his crew lived on,
Which proves it's hard to get get the best of a man named John

What a Town Without Pity can do..

The young have problems Many problems
We need an understanding heart..
Why don't they help us, try to help us
Before this clay and granite planet falls apart...

Take these eager lips and hold me fast..
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
