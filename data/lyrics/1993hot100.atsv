If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You, my darling you, mm

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

And I will always love you
I will always love you, you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you
Darling, I love you
I'll always, I'll always love you

I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you do to me
It's a feeling that I don't understand

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time after time I try to fight it
Your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In your condition I don't want to be alone

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, oh

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love so sweet
Knocks me off my feet

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins
I get so weak
Boy it's something I can't explain

I get so weak
Something 'bout the way ya do the things you do it
Knocks me right off of my feet, oh
I can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride

I'm feelin' manly and you say it's comin' in handy
Slidin' my claws from New York down by your Virginia
Ticklin' you around Delaware before I enter
Total seduction, from face, hips, to feet
A wiggle and jiggle can make the night complete

Body and soul, makin' me wanna squish her
More just in the game a rumper like a sub-woofer
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
I don't mind stickin' it to her every single night
Come on pass the poom-poom, send it to papa
Shake it, baby, shake it, baby, shake it, don't stoppa
Let me see you do the booty hock, and now I'll make the booty stock
Now drop and do the booty rock

Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
One, two, three, and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
('Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'mma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man and at the same time burning her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
(Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom)

Dr. Dre:
Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
(So just chill till the next episode)

Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
Falling back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N-double O-P
D-O-double G-Y, D-O-double G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah)
So Dre (What up Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumping, city of Compton

Dr. Dre:
Is where it takes place so when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slipping
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
Like this, that, this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?

With no vivid reason here to find
But yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
Around my mind
('Round my mind, oh, 'round my mind)
K-Ci, sing it, sing it

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
And with you say 'No special place to go'
But when I ask, 'will you be coming back soon'
you don't know, never know, oh...

(JoJo)
I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cuz they always start to cry
Yeah, yeah, baby, well, well

'Cuz this time could mean good, goodbye

Bye-bye

Farewell, farewell

Farewell

(K-Ci)
Oh, why don't you tell me

(JoJo)
Well, well, well
Lately I've been staring in the mirror, oh, yeah
Very slowly picking me apart, oh
Saying I'm trying to tell myself that I have no reason
With your heart, yeah, yeah, yeah

(K-Ci)
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But, when I asked you other thoughts your keeping
You just said 'nothing changed'

(Jojo)
I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cuz they always start to cry

Oh, yes you do

I hope my premonition misses

Looking real fly while in cahoots
In the park where I can meet you
I'm Snow, here to relate to you
What started the trend of them Dazzey Duks
Ever since the summer of the 90s
Girls had a deal with the future behind
See many terms they use to express
We're talking about the butt cheeks not the breasts
Baby got back, junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo, need some fries with that shake
See many terms they use to relate
I love the girls with the big old booties
Right up front they call em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks hanging from the jeans
Even city girls can be country things
So if you get it got it good to dip to dug out
Dem damn Dazzey Duks are turning out
Sing!

While all the brothers show thier freak
And check out the way they step
Make a brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
And they're tan to the top all the way
But it don't matter what kinda legs you like
Still be kicking if those legs are lily white
So it makes no difference to you
As long as you're kicking them Dazzey Duks

Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better)

I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be

A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you, ohh

A whole new world(A whole new world)

Sittin' over here
Starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes
Sure don't give a damn and
Ya don't know
That I've been dreamin' of ya in my fantasy

Never once you looked at me,
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you
To fulfill my needs
Think what you want
Let your mind free
Run free to a place that no one dares to

How many nights I've laid in bed excited over you
I've closed my eyes and thought of us,
A hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times
I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl
Oh the things I'll do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman,
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, and I won't
But, if I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time 'cause we've got all night
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like
If you like, I'll go down
Da down down down da down down
I'll hold you in my hand and baby

You're smooth and shiny feels so good against my lips, sugar
I want you so bad I can taste your love right now, baby
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl
Oh the things I'll do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman,
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, and I won't
But, if I was your girl

If I was your girl

Ooh... (Nights I've laid in bed excited over you)

Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like the madman laughing at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the same

Yo, this is how I'm comin' for the nine deuce
Another fat, fat track
So Rhythum D, pour the orange juice
And let's relax while sippin' on yak
Because it's like that
I'm conscious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic
I wear a jimmy for the skins 'cause it's a long trim
Front row seats, aiyo, I know she's on the nine inch

Just to get a piece of the green but she's an undertaker
Now you know the Paper is an around the world heart-breaker
Me be singin' first, but yo, had to have a breakdown
Paid in full, so now you know why my belly's round
Pickin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds
Just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, takin' it to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your women, G
'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me

It make a man say, "Damn"
I'm finally taxin' more, play than homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is help up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this groove in ninety two
Hey, you don't bother me and I sure never won't bother you

And ah, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagra
Think before you step, because these niggas just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold D's on my four and gold lex 'cause I got it made
I brought the beat on once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track, and yo, any way is OK
Your place or mine, all night until the next day
Unh

Do the ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the ditty, ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go from the top
Second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, all should be happy with ding-dong
It's since a man clock a grip,, G
It's like every nickel and dime nigga be like
"See, don't you remember me?"
A hustler, and his snow with more hoes to lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so they can play with my eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove

Pick up the mic and all of a sudden I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing
Straight behind my hoes so miss me with the chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin
Tote on his ass when I scoop him 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh

Do the ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the ditty, ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go
Uh, let's take a trip to another land
Clock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the lexo, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me, my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But Im like 'whats up witcha?', you ain't heard a damn thing
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection

And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'Cause doin' the ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Leave you kinda startled like the funk off of fritos
Make you man jealous, while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the piper with concern
And I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And for those disagree, and then jock, that's a pitty
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the ditty
Yeah

Do the ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the ditty, ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To the river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep

I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I'd never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To the river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That is running to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night

(I go walking in the middle of the...)

There's gonna be some rain gonna be some pain
But as long as I know

'Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you

Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow

I won't hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?

Don't walk away from me
I have nothing
Nothing
Nothing, if I don't have you (you-oo, you-oo, you)

You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love (mm...)

Uhh, I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will our memories survive?
Uhh, one I can hold on to

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow
I'm holdin' back again

There's nowhere to hide
You're the love I remember forever

Here, have a dollar,
In fact, no brother-man here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you

"Be strong, serve God only,
know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits"
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate

Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum,
until I had the chance to really get to know one

Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused

Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal

Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum

His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him, but I just saw him
Eat off the food we waste

Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no?
Who are we to judge?
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
Or killed over a racist grudge

Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, 'cause on him we walk

Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh,
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall

Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal, yeah
Mr. Wendal, yeah
Mr. Wendal, go ahead

Mr. Wendal
Lord, Mr. Wendal

Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still, I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'll say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well, now, pride's gone out the window 'cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'll say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

(Just blown away)

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Every world is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world is my world

And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing
I've ever seen before or will again

And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself
If we don't go all the way tonight

And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God of
Sex and drums and rock 'n' roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I'm watching you dance and the thunder rolls

And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
And I would do anything for love

Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?

I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

Now, I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I've got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot, ha?
Will you take me places I've never known?

Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

I've become amused
I've become blind
I've become what I know not breathes
You seem illiterate to all my emotions
I stand corrected, how well you read
You speak the truth, you speak the me
You feel the love I have yet to find
I know it's there, I know it's there
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
Pathetic me, I long to be you
I think I'm close but i stand so far
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
I miss the love only 'cause they starve'
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
I life and death my way through the sun
Where originates all the pain that leaves
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you

Well define my love with attitude
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
You can always tell
But I know remorse so well
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason

Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

The channel, a professional liar
How I long to contradict those vibes
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
It's not the love and I quest the why
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
The fear of pity is always awake
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
It's the windows, the doors, the passageways to the truth
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
In total recall as wild as the deuce
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
So superficial is the open wound
I caress the infinite light
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you

Well, define my love, that lives within you
Even when I die, it will sing to you
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason

Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

My immaculate dream made of breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed with a home tattoo
"Happy birthday to you" was created for you

(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Cannot believe you're taking my heart to pieces)

Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime to come undone now

We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chill, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeling off your fingers?

(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Cannot believe you're taking my heart to pieces)

Lost, in a snow filled sky, we'll make it all right
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon

It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere
And we both know what
But meaning's getting stronger
We must stop pretending
I can't live this life

I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me

It seems to me lately
You look at me the wrong way
And I start to cry
Could it be that maybe
This crazy situation is the reason why

I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
Tired of all these games

Oh, baby don't you know
I don't wanna hurt no more
This time I'm walking, babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We have to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
Don't wanna hurt no more

But, baby don't you know, know
I don't wanna hurt no more
Too much talking
Don't care now who's to blame

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Being lowdown
I do the showdown with any little ho' 'round (NO!)
I wanna know who you're believing
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheating
You said I know you're mister O.P.P man
You P.P man
Won't only see me man
You should've know that I ain't hitting the step
That I was with it a bit
Not to consider the rep (Heck!)
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty By Nature
Not cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark

You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho
Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

Hip Hop, Hip, Hip Hop, Hip, Hip Hop Hooray
There's many hungry Hip Hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's the top today
Swerve what you heard
Cause I ain't baling no hay
Ain't chopping no crop
But still growing every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Ill town
Drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns
Beat downs are found
Don't know me! Don't come around!

Tippy tippy pause
Tippy tippy pause
Some start creepin' up, I eat 'em up
Their styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That's the way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty's purr
Now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver name is Mook
I'm hittin' woodies in a hoody
Peace to Jesette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Jenae and every hood Gee
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S & Quest, Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop
So Hip Hop Hooray, ho-hey-ho-hey-ho-hey-ho

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs:

It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants

All that she wants

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's a hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever

It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

Ohohoho

Ohohoho

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheaheah

All that she wants

My shattered dreams and broken heart
Are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands
Standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
I gave my best to you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to my last cry

I was here, you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie

I know I gotta be strong
Cause round me life goes on and on and on and on

I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I end my one last cry

One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind for the very last  time
Been living a lie
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down...
To my last cry

(Verse One (Kandi):)
Every man wants a woman,
Where him and her can just go hang.
Just the two of them alone, kick back,
Doing their own thing.
And every man wants a woman,
That can always keep him in the mood.
And I'm that kind of girl,
So this is what I tell my dude.

(Chorus:)
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.
(Repeat x2)

(Verse Two (Kandi):)
Every man wants a woman,
That can cook him up a good meal.
A woman he can treat like his homie,
And take her out on the Ave. and just chill.
Every man wants a woman,
That ain't good for just laying on her back.
(LaTocha):And I'm that kind of woman,
(Kandi):So before me and my man get in the sack...

(Chorus:)
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.
(Repeat x4)

(Rap)
This is for the nigga's
Strictly for the nigga's
This is for the nigga's
The real nigga's

Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.

Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever

(Tupac)
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around

What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

(Shock G)
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

(Money B)
What's up love, how you doing? (All right)
Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around

(Tupac)
2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please

Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around

Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment
This morning I don't know

'Cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist
I wake up and french kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps it's own beat
In my head while we're talking

About all of the things that I long to believe
About love, the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is
Baby, you're all that I need

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as your Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
Each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes, I'd give each night
To see through this pay phone

Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
"Baby, blind love is true."

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as your Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye
Well, I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died, ooh yeah

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress, she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again

Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as your Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as your Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

We are lovers true and through and though
We made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to
Satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration,
Be the real love that I need

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

Oooh, when I met you I just knew that
You would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations
Lead me toward some real love

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

I got to have a real love

Loves so true and oh baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer to
The question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards
The love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good luvin' through the summer time,
Winter, spring, and fall

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love
'cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way because it
Seems he can't be found

Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Real love. I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love. I'm searching for a real love

Must be one and the same

It's down on me
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind, girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me takes my breath away

My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away

He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
"I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know, I'm gonna be like you"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play
Could you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today
I got a lot to do." He said, "That's okay"

And he walked away
And he smiled and he said
"You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
"I'm proud of you
Could you sit for a while?"

He shook his head, and he said with a smile
"What I'd really like, Dad
Is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
"I'd like to see you, if you don't mind
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time"

"You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talkin' to you"
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know when
We'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then"

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me

What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down hey
What about your friends are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around or will they turn their backs on you

Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically
Say I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never though they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down hey
What about your friends are they gonna be low down

I don't take a dulo
Lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style: wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe
I'll explain
A nigga like me is goin' insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane
Got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Insane in the brain
In the brain
It's because I'mloco

Insane in the brain
In the brain
It's because I'mloco

Insane in the brain
In the brain
Insane
It's because I'mloco

Insane in the brain

Like Louie Armstrong
Played the trumpet
I'll hit dat bong and break ya off something soon
I got to get my props
Cops
Come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground
To the next town
They get mad
When they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate pilot
Of this ship if I get
Wit' the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen
Look, but don't make your eyes strain
A nigga like me is goin' insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane
Got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Insane in the brain
It's because I'mloco
Insane in the brain
It's because I'mloco

Insane in the brain
It's because I'mloco
Insane in the brain
It's because I'mloco

I think I'm going crazy

I feel it
It's coming

Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain...

When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time
To tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard

I know it's real
Rain is what this thunder brings
For the first time, I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain...

When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye
Could you see my tears...
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say

I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I wait for the light,
I'll wait for the sun, till I feel your

Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say... never go away...

Waiting is the hardest thing (It's strange)
I tell myself that if I believe in you (I feel like I've known you before)
In the dream of you (I want to understand you more)
With all my heart and all my soul (And more and more)
That by sheer force of will (When I'm with you)
I will raise you from the ground (I feel like a magical child)
And without a sound you'll appear (Everything strange)
And surrender to me (Everything wild)
To love

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time, I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

Rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
Feel it on my finger tips

Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain...

I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...

You step out on the mountaintop
And you're free to call my name
Rain...

That's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying

That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go

You're just a fool
You say that I'm number one
And you'll always be true

How can this be?
You say you've fallen in love
You don't know what it means

But look around and you will see
Broken promises and jealousy
Is that what you should want for us to be?
One time lover turned enemy

But that's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying

That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go

All I can say is that
I'm looking no further ahead than today
Too young for this game
On the road to forever we don't know the way

So just forget about eternity
All the promises we just can't keep
Look down any street that's what you'll see
I don't wanna bring you to your knees

But that's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying

That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go

That's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying

That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go

Say it's gonna be alright

Do you believe in us (us)
Just give it half a chance
Yes our love (love)
Will still be strong
Girl I believe in us (Girl I believe in us)

Time has redefined the meaning
Love - the way we know it
Love - the way we show it

Unless you want them to
Forever ain't long enough, baby

But I still wanna hold you close

So give me the morning
Sharing another day with you
Is all I want to know

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes
Still shines, you shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go

And I, I didn't wanna tell you
Things I didn't wanna know myself
I was afraid to show
But you, you gave me a reason
A reason to face the truth, oh yes you did
To face the truth, face the truth
Face the truth

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes
Still shines, you shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go
Won't let me go, let go of my heart

I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you again

The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

(CHORUS)
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes

(CHORUS)

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

Break
Shit
Yo
Yo, uh

Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked a breakfast with no hog (Damn)

I got my grub on but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
(What's up?) Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'
Thinking "Will I live another twenty-fo'?"

I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night

Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
"Which court are y'all playin' basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like M.J.
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me

No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin'Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?

Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Little Joe

I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones and I'm yellin' "Domino!"
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day (Shit)

Left my nigga's house paid (What)
Picked up a girl I been tryin' to fuck since the twelfth grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the SuperSonics

I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep

Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube "The Top Gun"
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion

I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams

No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning, got the fat burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear blimp
And it read "Ice Cube's a pimp." (Yeah)

Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Halfway home and my pager still blowing up
Today, I didn't even have to use my AK
I got to say, it was a good day (Shit)

Hey wait, wait a minute, Pooh
Stop this shit
What the fuck I'm thinking about?

Them they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us flow a rush when the DJ's boomin classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fatter joints called undergrounds
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era?
Was fresh and fat since they started sayin outie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The puba of the styles like miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock

But
I'm cool like dat, I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat, I'm cool like dat

Them they be crazy down with the ?five plate?
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me I be diggin it with s bump verse
Us we be freakin til dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile so I say hi (wassup)
Who understood yeah understood the plan
Him heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip let borders get loose
How to consume or they'll be just like juice
If its the shit we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic
Hip hop gains a classic
Pimp playin shock it dont matter I'm fatter
Ax Butta how I zone (man Cleopatra Jones)

And
I'm chill like dat, I'm chill like dat

We get ya free cause the clips be fat boss
Them they're the jams and commence to goin off
She sweats the beat and ask me cause she puffed it
Me I got crew kids seven and a crescent
Us cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him thats my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn non-pigs
The rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll
The lyrics just like loot come in stacks and rolls
You used to find a bug in a box with fade
Now he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids

There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shown on me
I want my life  to be
Lived with you
Lived with you

There's a way
Everybody says
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you

Baby you don't know what its like
Baby you don't know what its like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my mind
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
But I'm blind
So very blind

I'm a man
Can't you see what I am
I live and breathe and for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you

Baby you don't know what its like
Baby you don't know what its like

He is not seeing Raneka
He is.
How you know?
Wait a minute guys.
Wait wait wait. You guys, we should not attack her, it sounds like it's
serious because we can't concentrate and get this right. So, let's deal with
the problem.
You see, I've been through this myself, and, let's talk.
And it goes a little something like this - hit it.
Mmm.....

Verse 1:
Baby girl (unfair but true)
Can love him once but not twice
Who plays games with no rules (a fool)
Tears for fears (are no surprise)
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)
Love 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life
I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Chorus:
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have

Verse 2:
Fact of life (so sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love, can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time, to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come
I've seen time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Chorus:
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have
(Give it up)
Give it up
(Give up)
Give it up
(Give up)
Give it up
Give it up turn it loose
Turnin' it loose, baby

Just kick a little somethin' for them cars that be bumpin'
Somethin' real smooth
You can just ride to
Tell me how you feel
Here we go...
The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac
See, the bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No moms trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac
I says "What I am is what I am is who I be"
And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright.

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me with the braids, the shades, some pants,
And some Nikes, G
And yet more letters, and the letters sayin'
"I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?"
Yesssss.....
I try to pass 'em my autograph
I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood
Ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good
Cause I'm down like four flat tires
Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj.
Showin' I can do right and not do wrong
Rappers and the Beejees comin' up strong
And we ain't got no love for the side
We only love those who love us back
Right?

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast
Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know
Really know
The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
Early mornin' interviews then we step to school
Step from school
Back to interviews then it's on to other dues
So, warm it up Chris
I said "Ya warm it up Chris"
That's what I was born to do
Now throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side
If the feelin' thatcha feelin' is the feelin' of pride
See, I ain't come out wack I come out right
Unlike those 'mose who tried to pass the mike
It's the Daddy Mac
Big thing
Everything is real but you wanna dis cause a nigga sold a couple mill.
Look here, ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line
So when you dis it just lets me know I'm on your mind
And it's alright

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in fields of gold

So she took her love
For to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
You forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold

Break it down again
So those are my dreams
And these are my eyes
Stand tall like a man
Headstrong like a horse

When it's all mixed up
Better break it down

In the world of secrets
In the world of sound

It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new about you and your inner song
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground
(Break it down again)
I want to break it down
(Break it down again)

Break it down again
So those are my schemes
And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force

When it's all mixed up
Better break it down

In the world of silence
In the world of sound

"No sleep for dreaming" say the architects of life
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella save it for a rainy day
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground
(Break it down again)
I want to break it down
(Break it down again)

Horsin' around
Pray to power
Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
And they won't simmer, won't simmer, won't simmer down
Play to the crowd
Play to the crowd
Play yeah yeah

It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new to help you
With the ups and downs
(Break it down again)
I want to break it down
(Break it down again)
Break it down again

Here we go!

I've heard people say that
Too much of anything
Is not good for you baby
But... I don't know about that
...As many times as we've loved
Shared love and made love
It doesn't... seem to me
Like it's ever, ever enough
It's just not enough

CHORUS:
My darling, I, can't get enough of your love babe
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe

Oh some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give the more I want
And baby that's no lie, oh no babe

Tell me what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel, when everything is you you you
What kind of love is this
That you've given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet
All I know is every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

(repeat chorus)

If I could make you see
And make you understand
Your love for me is all I need
and more than I can stand
Oh well babe

How can I explain
All the things I feel
You've given me so much
You're so unreal, unreal, unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
What am I gonna do
Cause you've blown my mind
I get the same old feeling
Every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing

(repeat chorus)

Walk away if you want to
It's okay if you need to
You can run but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you
There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, yeah

Take the time to think about it
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire that's burning up inside me
Now there's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all
No

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, yeah
Ohh

Ohh
There's a magic running through your soul
But you, you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind

Yeah, baby
Two steps behind
Ohh, sugar
Two steps behind
