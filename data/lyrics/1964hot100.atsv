Nobody gives a hang for what I say or do But you. And in the shelter of your arms I find peace and comfort and care. For I am wanted there.  In this cold world I struggle to survive And sometimes I would fall.  You'll think someone Would lend a helping hand they'd sooner to see me crawl.  Now just when life itself seems more than I can bare, your there. And in the shelter of your arms, I find strength and safety in them, I rise and start again.  Just give me one good reason To go on living To keep on trying. For what. I ask you for what. If not for you and all your love To see me through.  When times look bad The shelter of your arms will keep away each fear. And this cold world Can never get me down As long as you are here.  That's why I pray to god You'll never say goodbye. And I will know the shelter of your arms And your love for all of my life. Until the day I die.
