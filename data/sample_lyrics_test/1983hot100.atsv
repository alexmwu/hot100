63@Kinks@Come Dancing@They put a parking lot on a piece of land Where the supermarket used to stand Before that, they put up a bowling alley On the site that used to be the local palais That's where the big bands used to come and play My sister went there on a Saturday  Come dancing All her boyfriends used to come and call Why not come dancing? It's only natural  Another Saturday, another date She would be ready, but she'd always make him wait In the hallway, in anticipation He didn't know the night would end up in frustration He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek  Come dancing That's how they did it when I was just a kid And when they said come dancing My sister always did  My sister should have come in at midnight And my mom would always sit up and wait It always ended up in a big row When my sister used to get home late  Out of my window I could see them in the moonlight Two silhouettes saying good nights by the garden gate  What are you doing out there? Come on! Are you gonna be out there all night?  The day they knocked down the palais My sister stood and cried The day they knocked down the palais Part of my childhood died, just died  Now I'm grown up and playing in a band And there's a car park where the palais used to stand My sister's married, and she lives on an estate Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait She knows they get away with things she never could But if I asked her, I wonder if she would  Come dancing Come on, sister, have yourself a ball Don't be afraid to come dancing It's only natural  Come dancing Just like the palais on a Saturday And all her friends would come dancing While the big bands used to play
