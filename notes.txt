What is your supervised learning problem statement -- what will be your classes? I am assuming it is the problem statement 2. 

How will you get to the problem statements 1 and 3 with k-means clustering. 

You will not necessarily need to split the data into training and testing for clustering work. Think of 1 and 3 as telling a descriptive story about data. The 2 will require training and testing. 

Will you be writing your own code for bag-of-words? 

Bag of words
See if decades cluster--use year as label to color in clustering
- hierarchical

Reads in all data files in train and test directories
Adds year and decade columns to data
Creates bag of words
Performs random forest classifer using decade as class
Tests model on test data
